You don't want me anymore,
So I'll just walk right out that door.
Played a game right from the start,
I trust you, you used me, now my heart's all torn apart.
So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.
Try to see if I'll give up,
But there wasn't any luck.
That's a fact, a fact of life.
That's the game, game of strife, everything is all in stride.
So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.
So I'm sailin', well I'm sailin' on.
I'm movin', hey I'm movin' on.
Sail on, sail on, sail on, sail on.
There's too many years with too many tears,
Too many days with nothin' to say.
How will we know when there's nowhere to grow?
What's the facts for life too short?
Don't need no ivory liquid. Don't want no afro sheen.
Don't need the latest fashions. Don't want my hair to smell clean.
I've got my automotion,
I've got that superpotion.
And if you think I'm going crazy,
Then pretty baby it might be true babe.
We don't need no first class. Don't need no second class.
All of the best-of, all that can kiss my ass.
I've got my claim to fame,
I've got that positive flame.
And if you think I'm going crazy,
Then pretty baby it might be you babe.
Don't care what they may say
We got that attitude
Don't care what they may do
We got that attitude
Hey we got the PMA
Hey we got the PMA
Don't care what they may do
We got that attitude
I don't care what they may say
We got that attitude

Don't care what they may say
We got that attitude
Don't care what they may do
We got that attitude
You tell me what to say and when to say it.
You tell me what to do and how to do it.
And if I ask you why, you'll arrest me.
And if I call you a liar, you'll detest me.
You control what I'll be.
You control who I see.
And if I let you,
You control me.
You're the man who owns all the keys to the stores.
You're the man who always wants so much more.
You're the regulator.
You're the regulator.
You're the regulator.
You're the regulator.
Banned in D.C. with a thousand more places to go
Gonna swim across the Atlantic, cause that's the only place I can go
You, you can't hurt me
Why? I'm banned in D.C.
D.C.
We, we got ourselves
Gonna sing it, gonna love it, gonna work it out to any length
Don't worry, no worry, about what people say
We got ourselves, we gonna make it anyway
You, you can't hurt me
Why? I'm banned in D.C.
D.C., D.C
And if you ban us from your clubs
It's the right time, the right mind
And if you think we really care
You won't find in my mind
No! You can't afford
To close your doors, so soon no more
My, oh my, I'll let you down
Upon the ground, so soon no more
No! You can't afford
To close your doors, so soon no more
My, oh my, I'll let you down
Upon the ground
Some people look at me and talk about me like a clown
They just don't realize it's just my simple way to get down
I've got that supertouch
Chances are I've got too much
I've come to let you see
That you also can be free
It seems like everytime we all try to go underground
The stinkin' troopers them, they think that we are fooling around
We have had about enough
Now we're gonna get real tough
It happens everyday
That's why we got P.M.A.
We can see most everything
We've got that supertouch
We can see most everything
We've got that supertouch
People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
My best ain't good enough for you
My test is what you gonna do
Ain't no any kind of way
Love was lost in yesterday
Now we've felt this, so you'll get yours now
Everybody's living and nobody's giving
And nobody gives a damn
You must understand me, the end is surely coming
Prepare for the final plan
People just pretending, that's a let down
Undercover lover, that's my heart now
Struggle just in living, that's the realm of
Accept me as I'm not, and that's a shitfit
Well I say
Say I'm leaving this Babylon
I'm leaving this Babylon
It will not be too long now
It will not be too long
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I said my people are starvin'
But your money's runnin'
I say your dollar, dollar drop down real low
You ain't got no gold to show
We gonna step right through that door
We not gonna come back no more
I said the politician lyin'
My momma just a cryin'
And nothing ever gonna change
My papa just a sighin'
My sister just a lyin'
And I ain't got nothing to say
Well I say
Well I say
The bourgeoisie had better watch out for me
All throughout this so called nation
We don't want your filthy money
We don't need your innocent bloodshed
We just wanna end your world
Well my mind's made up
Yes it's time for you to pay
Better watch out for me
I'm a member of the F.V.K.
Not as much but with such intensity
I'd like to be what they would not want me to be
I like to cram their chivalry inside their guts
I'd like to leave it all behind with the rest of the nuts
I, oh
Not as much but with more feeling now
I'd like to forget about you and try to break it somehow
I'd like to push it aside until I can see some more
I'd like to leave you where I found you lying on the floor
I, oh
I guess it's too bad, I guess it's too bad
I guess it's too bad, too bad
For you!
It seems the truth always prevails on your face
And in the end I see what's in its place
So in the future you just may see
That's what you'll receive is what you gave to me
I, oh, oh
No one dared to show for that shower
When nobody turned to be clean
Was not even touched by the water
Just another Nazi scheme
Yeah, the big takeover yeah
My, big takeover yeah, yeah
All throughout this so called nation
Prepare yourself for the final quest
This world is doomed with its own segregation
Just another Nazi test
Yeah, the big takeover yeah
My, big takeover yeah, yeah
So understand me when I say
There's no love for this USA
This world is doomed with its own segregation
Just another Nazi test
Yeah, the big takeover yeah
My, big takeover yeah, yeah
I make decision with precision
Lost inside this manned collision
Just to see that what is to be
Perfectly my fantasy
I came to know with now dismay
That in this world we all must pay
Pay to write, pay to play
Pay to cum, pay to fight
And all in time,
With just our minds
We soon will find
What's left behind
Not long ago when things were slow
We all got by with what we know
The end is near. Hearts filled with fear
Don't want to listen to what they hear
And so it's now we choose to fight
To stick up for our bloody right
The right to sing, the right to dance
The right is ours... We'll take the chance
A peace together
A piece apart
A piece of wisdom
From our hearts
You can't disappear anymore
I see your face lurking outside the window
You say you're a trifle, I'm a bore
You touch yourself, put your face in the pillow
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right Brigade
Makes no difference to me
What side you choose, what side will lose
All there is to perceive
Is what I want, and I know how to get it
But the funny thing about you is
You remembered to leave it behind
And the funny thing about me is
I'm a member of the Right...
Right Brigade
Right Brigade
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
Walking down Babylon Lane
Me trying to live my life in peace
Two young men call me not their brother
They try to make I feel ashamed
But I love, I Jah, yeah
He tell me not to be that way
I love, I Jah, yeah
I gotta keep my PMA
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
I love, I love, I Jah
My lovely sister judge me by my clothes, yeah
Only to learn to her mistake, not everyone's alike
We're not all a uptight, ah, no fuss, no fight
Cool that way, let me tell you 'bout the cool that way
And I love, I Jah, yeah
He tell me not to be that way
I love, I Jah, yeah
I gotta keep my PMA
Caressing bent up to the jug again
With sheaths and pills
Invading all those stills
In a hovel of a bed
I will scream in vain
Oh please, miss lane
Leave me with some pain
Went walking through this city's neon lights
In fear of disguising my warping seathing
Pressure lines and graceless heirs
Intangible of price
Trying so hard to find what was right
I came upon your room it stuck into my head
We leapt into the bed degrading even lice
You took delight in taking down
All my shielded pride
Until exposed became my darker side
Puckering up and down some avenue of sin
Too cheap to ride they're worth a try
If only for the old times, cold times
Don't go waving your pretentious love
He's soliciting on his tan brown brogues (dark entries...)
Girating through some lonesome devils row (dark entries...)
Pinpointing well meaning upper class prey (dark entries...)
Of walking money checks possessing holes (dark entries...)
He often sleekly offers his services (dark entries...)
Exploitation of his finer years (dark entries...)
Work with loosely woven fabrics (dark entries...)
Of lonely office clerks (dark entries...)
Any lay suffices his dollar green eye (dark entries...)
I came upon your room it stuck into my head
We leapt into the bed degrading even lice
You took delight in taking down
All my shielded pride
Until exposed became my darker side
Puckering up and down some avenue of sin
Too cheap to ride they're worth a try
If only for the old times, cold times
Don't go waving your pretentious love
Dark entries
Dark entries
Dark entries
Dark entries
I dare you to be real
To touch
To touch a flickering flame
The pangs
The pangs of dark delight
Don't cower
Don't cower in night fright
Don't back away just yet
From destinations set
I dare you to be proud
To dare to shout aloud
For convictions that you feel
Like sound from bells to peal
I dare you to despise
Bureaucracy and all its lies
And avoid
And avoid their stare
They never
They never dare to dare
I dare
I dare
I dare you you
A gut pull drag on me
Into the chasm gaping we
Mirrors multi-reflecting this
Between spunk stained sheet
And odorous whim
Camera eye-flick-shudder within
Assist me to walk away in sin
Where is the string that Theseus laid
Find me out this labyrinth place.
I do get bored, I get bored
In the flat field.
I get bored, I do get bored
In the flat field
Yin and yang lumber punch
Go taste a tart, then eat my lunch
And force my slender thin and lean
In this solemn place of fill wetting dreams
Of black matted lace of pregnant cows
As life maps out onto my brow
The card is lowered in index turn
Into my filing cabinet hemispheres spurn.
I do get bored, I get bored
In the flat field.
I get bored, I do get bored
In the flat field
Let me catch the slit of light
For a maidens sake
On a maiden flight
In the flat field I do get bored
Replace with Piccadilly whores
In my yearn for some cerebral fix
Transfer me to that solid plain
Hammer me into blazen pain
Moulding shapes no shame to waste
Moulding shapes no shame to waste
And drag me there with deafening haste.
Go and look for the dejected once proud
Idol remembered in stone aloud
Then on coins his face was mirrored
Take a look it soon hath slithered
To a fractured marble slab, renunciation clad
His nourishment extract from his subjects
That mass production profile
He's a God- in- in an alcove
Once he spread the rain
So they dreamt in vain
Once he spread the wheat
Had made garlands for his feet
Until the lily poet of our times
Horizoned on the line
Love became the in theme then
Opposing fakers thrice by ten
Don't perceive his empty plea
That redundant effigy
He's a God- in- in an alcove
Take in view his empty stool
What's left is satin cool
Clawing adornment for his crimes
They saw they had to draw the line
So they sent him far away
So they sent him far away
To a little alcove
To a little alcove
All alone
He's a God, a God
Now I am silly
Now I am silly
Silly, silly, silly, silly
Silly
We're going down
We're going down
We're going down
To the kamikaze dive
Fishnet leatherette
Pussy Galore
Pseudo Sumo wrestler
On the door
Dangerous dances
The dragon's claw
K-Tel Oriental
The monkey's paw
You're a dead ringer
For Madame Butterfly
Snappy little fingers
Stitch my thigh
You're so necromantic
Venomous and vain
Mixing molotov cocktails
In the subterrain
We're going down to the kamikazi dive
Like insects in a Chinese lantern now
We're feeling so alive, what's showing?
We're going down to the kamikaze dive
Like manic moths in Chinese lanterns now
We're feeling so alive, what's showing?
Hidden in the dashboard
The unseen mechanized eye
Under surveillance
The road is full of cats eyes
It's sick function to pry
The spy in the cab
Coldly observing- callously reserving
A drivers time
Automated autonomy
Playing on his mind
The spy in the cab
The spy in the cab
An eye for an eye
A spy for an eye
An eye for an eye
A spy for a spy
A twenty-four hour unblinking watch
Installed to pry
Installed to cop
The spy in the cab
The spy in the cab
The spy in the cab
I spy with my little eye spy with my little I spy with my
Little eye spy with my little I spy... spy... spy
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks
See the young man in his new gown
Small talk stinks
Talking up to his bouffant drag
Something that he's never had
He says he loves you with flowers
A sentence should be like a serpent
Quick with a sting in its tail
String me a line that has meaning and depth
There's no small talk with walky talkies
Small talk stinks.
I said it stinks
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks.
You whisper sweet nothings chit-chat-back-chat
There's no idle gossip in braille
Taking combs three times an day
Twice an hour
Indentikit cute lips from wall to wall
See the young man in his new gown
Stand in line for the photo call
Talking up to his bouffant drag
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks
Small talk stinks
Back in the good old days when dancing meant exploding
The idea was simple for a decent overloading
And for a multiple flash with no cords attached
He came up with a more remote flash trigger
It's connected to an accessory in his hip
Which automatically fires in perfect synchro
But perhaps his most exciting development is his angle
They call it the dance
It's the St. Vitus dance
Such flexibility
What an accessory
See his soft bounce
What flexibility
Such a soft bounce
What an accessory
And for special effects he has six filters
Three coloured red with the others pilfered
And if you really want to know what that means
He could throw a blue flash from eighty-five feet
Of course you might want to check out your own little output
So we devised a few simple and easy to crack contortions
So you can bump and scrape all the day through
With the dance
It's the St. Vitus dance
The St. Vitus dance
Such flexibility
What an accessory
Such a soft bounce
What flexibility
Such a soft bounce
Check his hot shoe
Feel his output
He's a light machine
See his angle
He's a light machine
In a crucifixation ecstasy
Lying cross chequed in agony
Stigmata bleed continuously
Holes in head, hands, feet, and weep for me
Stigmata oh you sordid sight
Stigmata in your splintered plight
Look into your crimson orifice
In holy remembrance
In scarlet bliss
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
In nomine patri et filii et spiriti sanctum
Father, son, and holy ghost
Stigmata Martyr
Nerve ends tick in flicker book animation
One eye's closed in fear, anticipation
Will it stay shut?  Will it ever open?
What if?
What if?
Nerves.
Tell tale tongues lick at seven senses
Brittle spittle sparks you are defenseless
The fabric of dreams is ripped apart
Nerves.
As you feel the twist of the shadowed dagger
In your pumping heart
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Sense of serenity is shattered in the glint of splintered glass.
A trail of random cutlery cuts a dash in the concrete underpass
Nerves.
Nerves.
Nerves.
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel
Nerves like nylon, Nerves like steel

Virgin Mary was tired
So tired
Tired of listening to gossip
Gossip and complaints
They came from next door
And a bewildered stream of chatter
From all sorts of
All sorts of
Untidy whores
Came from next door
Came from next door
But some men are chosen from the rest
But their disappointment runs with their guests
Never would be invited to the funeral rosegarden
But their choice don't seem to matter
They got swollen breasts and lips that putter
And their choice of matter and their scream of chatter
Is just a little parasitic scream of whores
Screaming whores
In the rosegarden funeral of sores
Virgin Mary was tired
So tired of listening to gossip
Gossip and complaints
In the
In the
Rosegarden
Rosegarden funeral of sores
Terror couple kill colonel
Terror couple kill colonel
His eyes were heavy
He carried a card
One couple questioned
The other discharged
Terror couple kill colonel
in his West German home
Three shots from three feet
Dragged himself to the phone
Terror couple kill colonel
Terror couple kill colonel
And as he lay there
Playing games with his pain
He felt his choice of jobs
Was such a mistake
He could have been a doctor
In a soft easy chair
In stead he chose three stars
A territorial affair
Terror couple kill colonel
Terror couple kill colonel
In his West German home
In his West German home

What do you want of me
What do you long from me
A slim Pixie, thin and forlorn
A count, white and drawn
What do you make of me
What can you take from me
Pallid landscapes off my frown
Let me rip you up and down
For you I came to forsake
Lay wide despise and hate
I sing of you in my demented songs
For you and your stimulations
Take what you can of me
Rip what you can off me
And this I'll say to you
And hope that it gets through
You worthless bitch
You fickle shit
You will spit on me
You will make me spit
And when the Judas howl arise
And like the Jesus Jews you epitomize
I'll still be here as strong as you
And I'll walk away in spite of you

It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild

There won't be room for people like me
My life is their disease
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild
Spray paint the walls
It feels so good to say what I want
It feels so good to knock things down
It feels good to see the disgust in their eyes
It feels good, and I'm gonna go wild

My girlfriend asked me which one I like better

What do they know about partying
Or anything else
This feeling haunts me.
Behind these eyes
The shell seems so empty.
Though I wonder if anything lives inside?
I want to live
I wish I was dead
My heart aches to bleed.
I'm cheated from what I see.
Freedom holds a double-edge for me.
I look in your eyes and see...
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
I don't want to think.
I'm stuck here and I know it.
I don't want to see.
Make me close my eyes.
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
Life's cold.
Every thing's inside.
I need to feel,
But turn my mind off.
The desperation begins.
From the start I see the end.
Not right, I'm not right, you're not right.
I've got to close my eyes.
I look in your eyes
And see its always this way.
Live the lie and take a dive
Just to make it die.
I want to live.
I wish I was dead.
I've just got to close my eyes.
I've got to close my eyes.
I've got to close my eyes.
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight
TV party tonight!
We're gonna have a TV party tonight
All right!
We're gonna have a TV party, all right
Tonight!
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
Everybody's gonna hang out here tonight
All right!
We'll pass out on the couch, all right
Tonight!
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows
We sit glued to the TV set all night
And every night
Why go into the outside world at all
It's such a fright
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
TV news shows
What it's like out there?
It's a scare
You can go out if you want
We wouldn't dare
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
Don't talk about anything else
We don't want to know
We're dedicated to our favorite shows
I wouldn't be without my TV for a day
Or even a minute
I don't bother to use my brain any more
There's nothing left in it
We've got nothing better to do
Than watch TV
And have a couple of brews
Wait a minute
My TV set doesn't work
It's broken
What are we gonna do tonight?
This isn't fair
We're hurtin'
We've got nothing left to do
Left with no TV
Just a couple of brews
What are we gonna talk about... I don't know!
We're gonna miss our favorite shows
No
No TV party tonight
Thirsty and miserable
You drop to the floor
You drink 'til you can't
Even see any more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
My brother wants a ride
To the liquor store
You pity him
For what he wants it for
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
It's 1:30
And we're all getting nervous
The store closes at two
There's not enough to last us
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
Thirsty and miserable
Always wanting more
This fucking city
Is run by pigs
They take the rights
Away from all the kids
Understand
We're fighting a war
We can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win, no way!
Walk down the street
I flip them off
They hit me across the head
With a billy club
Understand
We're fighting a war
We can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win, no way!
Nothing I do,
Nothing I say
I tell them to go get fucked
They put me away
Understand
We're fighting a war
We can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win, no way!
I go to court,
For my crime,
Stand in line pay bail,
I waste my time
Understand
We're fighting a war
We can't win
They hate us
We hate them
We can't win, no way!
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
Sitting here I'm a loaded gun
Waiting to go off
I've got nothing to do
But shoot my mouth off
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
You know I'm gonna go out
Get something for my head
If I keep on doing this
I'm gonna end up dead
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
I know the world's got problems
I've got problems of my own
Not the kind that can't be solved
With an atom bomb
Gimme gimme gimme
I need some more
Gimme gimme gimme
Don't ask what for
Right here, all by myself
I ain't got no one else
The situation is bleeding me
There's no relief for a person like me
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression! I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me
I ain't got no friends to call my own
I just sit here all alone
There's no girls that want to touch me
I don't need your goddamn sympathy
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression! I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me
Everybody, just get away
I'm gonna boil over inside today
They tell me son, things are gonna get better
All I know is, they fucking better
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression! I gotta break free
Depression's got a hold of me
Depression's gonna kill me
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
If not you'll die too
And I'll see to it
It's hard to survive
Don't know if I can do it
Keep me alive
I can't accept my fate
I need help
Before it's too late
It's hard to survive, don't know if I can do it
I need to belong, I need to hang on
I need, need
Keep me alive feelings I must obey
Can't turn my eyes from the past
This crisis is the last
Keep me alive
I rely on your judgement
I've got none left of my own
Don't know what I'm doing
It's hard to survive, don't know if I can do it
I need to belong, I need to hang on
I need, need
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
Keep me alive
Only you can do it
It's hard to survive, don't know if I can do it
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
It's hard to survive, don't know if I can do it
I need to belong, I need to hang on
I need, need
Damaged by you
Damaged by me
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Stupid attempts
No conclusions
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Put the gun to my head
And I don't pull
I'm confused
Confused,
My emotions are bruised
I no longer feel a thing
I no longer want to see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick,
My live drips feelings cut
Stupid feelings
Stupid illusions
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Scars for me to wear
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
Things don't fit
Do I care
I'm confused
Confused,
Don't wanna be confused
I no longer feel a thing
I no longer want to see
But you can't make me long
For your life and security
Problems stick,
My live drips feelings cut
No, I won't believe that this is all
I'm not happy, I'm not free
Pay check to pay check,
Living for what
Every night I get drunk to ger sunk
I need action, won't take no more,
No more, no more, no more
It won't work, won't work
No more
I knew what I had when I grew up
I know that it really sucked
Now I'm a slave to the same lies
If I don't get out I'm gonna die
I need action, won't take no more,
No more, no more, no more
It won't work, won't work
No more
Control, control for who,
For what?
I'm no robot, they can get fucked
Reaction's masochism this can't last
I need to live, I need it now
I need action, won't take no more,
No more, no more, no more
It won't work, won't work
No more
Earth's a padded cell
Defanged and declawed
I'm living in hell it's a paradise fraud
Straight jacket minds in line to be old
Telling me to want,
Let time slip through my teeth
Well I'm not the fool,
I'm going to town
Manic reactions are always a buzz
I'm suspect, the stranger in disguise
It's forced itself upon me,
Something I can't hide
See it in - maniacs
Their eyes - maniacs
Maniacs, maniacs
Looking at you inside of you
Behind your eyes, through your mind
Looking at you, inside of you
I'm invisible, nowhere to hide
I'm obscene the living dead
See the flys feed off your head
Looking at you I'm inside of you
It's walden two but the flower's dead
See it in - maniacs
Their eyes - maniacs
Maniacs, maniacs
Earth's a padded cell
Defanged and declawed
I'm living in hell it's a paradise fraud
Straight jacket minds in line to be old
Telling me to want,

Well I'm not the fool,

Manic reactions are always a buzz
I'm suspect, the stranger in disguise
It's forced itself upon me,
Something I can't hide
See it in - maniacs
Their eyes - maniacs
Maniacs, maniacs
Look what you've done to your arms
I see you don't care who you harm
I understand
You've never been the girl next door
But now you're worse than before

Life's miseries pain is deep
Does it matter what anybody cares?
Can there be another outlet?
Nobody gets close, nobody dares
Self destruct

I can figure out the reasons why
But I can't help what I feel
I can't accept what I see
Self destruct

I just want a lover like any other
What do I get
I only want a friend who will stay to the end
What do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
I'm in distress I need a caress
What do I get
I'm not on the make I just need a break
What do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
I only get sleepless nights
Alone here in my half-empty bed
For you things seem to turn out right
I wish they'd only happen to me instead
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
I just want a lover like any other
What do I get
I only want a friend who will love to the end
What do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
What do I get
Oh oh what do I get
Well let me tell you now
I get no love
I get no sleep at nights
I get nothing that's nice
I get nothing at all
At all, at all, at all
At all, at all, at all
Cos I don't get you
Reality's a dream
A game in which I seem
To never find out just what I am
I don't know if I'm an actor or ham
A shamen or sham
But if you don't mind
I don't mind
I'm lost without a clue
So how can I undo
The tangle of these webs I keep weaving
I don't know if I should be believing
Deceptive perceiving
But if you don't mind
I don't mind
I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time I used to feel so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more
How can you convince me
When everything I see
Just makes me feel you're putting me down
And if it's true this pathetic clown'll
Keep hanging around
That's if you don't mind
I don't mind
I used to bet that you didn't care
But gambling never got me anywhere
Each time I used to be so sure
Something about you made me doubt you more
I even think you hate me when you call me on the phone
And sometimes when we go out I wish I'd stayed at home
And when I'm dreaming or just lying in my bed
I think you've got it in for me
Is it all in my head is it in my head
How can you convince me
When everything I see
Just makes me feel you're putting me down
And if it's true this pathetic clown'll
Keep hanging around
That's if you don't mind
I don't mind
I don't mind
I'm in love again
Been like this before
I'm in love again
This time's true I'm sure
Don't wanna end up like no nine day wonder
I've been hurt so many times before
So my darlin' I will never leave you
It's in my blood to always love you more
Love you more
It's my heart again
That drives me so wild
I just can't explain
Although I'm not a child
So why would I cry if you ever left me
Maybe 'cos you're all I'm livin' for
With every heartbeat I want you madly
It's in my blood to always love you more
Love you more
Oh my love again
What I say is true
Though it may sound plain
I love you
And it means more to me than life can offer
And if this isn't true love then I am sure
That after this love there'll be no other
Until the razor cuts
You spurn my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I run the risk of losing you
And that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love?
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? (Love...)
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
I can't see much of a future
Unless we find out what's to blame
What a shame
And we won't be together much longer
Unless we realize that we are the same
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love?
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? (Love...)
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
You disturb my natural emotions
You make me feel I'm dirt
And I'm hurt
And if I start a commotion
I'll only end up losing you
And that's worse
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love?
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? (Love...)
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone?
Ever fallen in love?
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? (Love...)
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love?
In love with someone
Ever fallen in love? (Love...)
In love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with
Fallen in love with
Ever fallen in love with someone
You shouldn't've fallen in love with...
Ah loving you is easy you are on my side
We play the game strictly to our rules
We led the field a love affair
Which made all other lovers fools
Oh
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us
We promised that we'd always have time for each other
Whenever I needed you'd be there
We promised to be true there'd be no other
We promised that for ever we would care
Oh
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
How can you ever let me down
These promises are made for us
We had to change
But you stayed the same
You wouldn't change
Oh what a shame
Cos loving you's not easy you're not on my side
We play a game with two sets of rules
We lead the field in a love affair
Ah strictly meant for fools
Oh
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises were made for us
You never have any time for me
Whenever I need you you're not there
You've never been true and it's plain to see
The fact is you never really cared
Oh
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Why did you ever let me down
Those promises we made for us
I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion love is a dream
But I don't know what it is
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
I was so tired of being upset
Always wanting something I never could get
Life's an illusion love is a dream
But I don't know what it is 'cos
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Life's an illusion love is the dream
But I don't know what it is
Everyone's saying things to me
But I know it's okay okay
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Life's an illusion love is a dream
Life's an illusion love is the dream
Life's the illusion love is a dream
Life's the illusion love is the dream
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Today's are good
Bet you are tired of being upset
Always wanting something you never can get
Life's no illusion love's not a dream
Now I know just what it is
Everybody's happy nowadays
Everybody's happy nowadays
Whenever I'm in doubt about things I do
I listen to the high street wailing sounds in a queue
I go out for my walking sailing social news
Don't let it get me down I'm long in the tooth
When I'm out in the open clattering shoppers around
The neon signs that take your eyes to town
Your thoughts are chosen your world is advertising now
And extravagance matters to worshippers of the pound
But it's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
The tortured faces expression out aloud
And life's little ironies seem so obvious now
Your cashed in cheques have placed the payments down
And there's a line of buses all wait to take you out
But it's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
It's a...
It's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
Whenever I'm in doubt about things I do
I listen to the high street wailing sounds in a queue
I go out for my walking sailing social news
Don't let it get me down I'm long in the tooth
'Cos it's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
It's a harmony in my head
Whatever happened to - twin sets
Whatever happened to - hi-fi
Whatever happened to - TV sex
Whatever happened to - you and I
Your passion is a product
(of) highlight and detail
That come hither look
Bonus offer retail
Whatever happened to - pick-up trucks
Whatever happened to - yellow pages
Whatever happened to - burning books
Whatever happened to - new ages
Your emotions are cheap
Cut price cash and carry
Your heart on your sleeve
For any Tom, Dick or Harry
Your love is a cashed-in cheque
Oh oh that's the way of all flesh
Whatever happened to - Chairman Mao
Whatever happened to - God above
Whatever happened to - the cow
Whatever happened to - plug-in love
Your pasteurised life so fit for consumption
Ooooo those undressing eyes so strictly commercial
Your love is a cashed-in cheque
Oh oh that's the way of all flesh
All flesh
All flesh
Oh shit I thought you and I were friends
Oh shit I guess this is where our love ends
Oh shit I thought things were goin' well
But it hasn't turned out so swell
Has it
Oh shit
Oh shit pride comes before a fall
Oh shit and once you lose one you've lost them all
Oh shit I guess this time's the time
And it seem you're no longer mine
Don't it
Oh shit
Oh shit
Oh shit I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit that you were such a cow
Oh shit I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit chasin' somethin' which wasn't mine
Face it
You're shit
You're shit
Oh shit I wish I'd known before now
Oh shit that you were such a fuckin' cow
Oh shit I wouldn't've wasted my time
Oh shit chasin' somethin' which could never be mine
Admit

You're shit
You're shit
Admit admit
You're shit
You're shit
You're shit
You're shit
You're shit
It's a thing that's worth having

There's bed in your eyes
But there's nothing there to trust
Just lust, just lust
You're telling me lies
When you say that it's a must
Just lust, just lust
You shattered all my dreams
And my head's about to bust
Is it all real - that's how it seems
But it all comes down to dust
Your hands feel a need
I don't know if it's too much
Just lust, just lust
It seems it's only greed
To taste all that you touch
Just lust, just lust
You shattered all my dreams
And my head's about to bust
Is it all real - that's how it seems
But it all comes down to dust
You're driven to possess
It hurts it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing matters less
Then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust
I was slow to catch on
And that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion
Then emotion is a curse
I was slow to catch on
And that just makes it worse
If passion is a fashion
Then emotion is a curse
You're driven to possess
It hurts it's so unjust
Just lust, just lust
If nothing mattered less
Then I wouldn't make a fuss
Just lust, just lust
It's my imagination
To see things as I choose
Love has a reputation
That it can only lose
When you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face
Will you miss me
In your dreams does your lover have my face
Ah when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face
Ah will you miss me
In your dreams does your lover have my face
It's the morning
And the mourning it is dawning on me too
I'd no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through
Ah it's the morning
And the mourning it is dawning on me too
I had no warning
Just a condolence card to tell me that we're through
Will you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face
When you miss me
In your dreams does my lover have your face
Ah when you kiss me
Does the lipstick on your lip stick on my face
Ah will you miss me
In your dreams does your lover have my face
Well it seems so real I can see it
And it seems so real I can feel it
And it seems so real I can taste it
And it seems so real I can hear it
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
Then it looks so real I can see it
And it feels so real I can feel it
And it tastes so real I can taste it
And it sounds so real I can hear it
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
Then it looks so real I can feel it
And it feels so real I can taste it
And it tastes so real I can hear it
And it sounds so real I can see it
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
Now it is so real I can see it
And it is so real I can feel it
And it is so real I can hear it
And it is so real I can be it
So why can't I touch it?
So why can't I touch it?
Tried to find my sock
No good it's lost
Something's gone wrong again
Need a shave
Cut myself need a new blade
Something's gone wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something's gone wrong again
Something's gone wrong again
Tried to fry an egg
Broke the yolk no joke
Something's gone wrong again
Look at my watch just to tell the time
But the hand's come off mine
Something's gone wrong again
Something's gone wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something's gone wrong again
Something's gone wrong again
Nothing ever happens to people like us
'Cept we miss the bus
Something goes wrong again
Need a smoke use my last 50p
But the machine is broke
Something's gone wrong again
Something goes wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
Nothing ever happens to people like us
'Cept we miss the bus
Something goes wrong again
Need a smoke use my last 50p
But the machine is broke
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
Turn up early in time for our date
But then you turn up late
Something goes wrong again
Need a drink go to the pub
But the bugger's shut
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
And again and again and again again and
Something goes wrong again
Ah something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
Something goes wrong again
I stumbled into an empty trap
I said I'm gonna cut you off
With just one way, a slap
I got no need to tell you
Just how it feels
All I want from you
Is to give up what you steal
You got nothing to show
And you know it
You're made of all I hate
I can taste it
I can't hurt you enough
But do you feel it?
You're useless
Ain't got no excuses
You're designed to kill
All that screaming's gonna rub off on you
They're gonna strip you raw
And beat you for your
And I don't care what weapons you use
Just as long as you keep me amused
You want the world beneath you
So you can slice it
They made you draw blood
And not just taste it
You got
So why waste it?
You're branded
Your mind's abandoned
You're designed to kill
You're designed to kill
I said you're designed to kill
My infatuation
Dry intoxication
You just come near me when you're asleep
Pretend I'm not true
Deceive you
When I reel you
You're only me
Subconscious treasure
Unconscious pleasure
Wondrous sensation
Pale creation
My amputation
My assassination
My infatuation
I don't wanna be happy
In fact I like living a lie
The bright brittle files
Gleaming and white
About their colourless crime
I could break them in two
With the glint of my eye
I don't want you to know me
Unless you are shallow or sly
Using my friends
I always depend on them like charades in the sky
Once I figure them out they're a waste of my time
I only live on the surface
I don't think people are very pretty inside
And my idea of love
Isn't having a son
Or being whipped on the back of my thighs
I prefer the ridiculous
To the sublime
Tighten my skin
I freeze inside
Don't you dare let me melt
You better caress my pride
I'm under glass
Stare if you please
You better behave
Wait at my ease
You can bite me
But not delight me
I've known of all
What you call love
I'm all dressed up
For you to carve
You better eat all you like
I'd rather starve
It's better than pleasure, it hurts more than pain
I've got what it takes to drive you insane
Now is the time to lose all control
Distort your body, twist your soul
Contort yourself, contort yourself
Hey baby, you better twist it
You never never never resist it
Contort yourself, contort yourself
Hey baby, don't you stick together
And one of you just fall apart
You better try being stupid instead of smart
And once you take out all the garbage
That's in your brain, forget about your future
Its just just just just too tame
Contort yourself, oh, I said you got to
I said you got to, you got to, you got to
You got to contort yourself
At first you arrive in position
And then you shatter your frame
And you stretch your resistance
Until your mind slips away
And once you forget your affection
For the human race
Reduce yourself to zero
And then you'll fall in place
Contort yourself one time
Contort yourself two times
Contort yourself three times
Contort yourself four times
Contort yourself five times
Can't tell the difference between the face
And your infection
I'm running out
You're sinkin' in, be my reflection
I love to tremble, these are my membranes
Let me inject ya around your throat
Inside your eyes then I'll inspect ya
Can't stand myself, throw me away
Oh well, my emotions, it made me alter
It deflates my passion, my hungry worship
Is just one more shackle you can't fasten
It better absorb me while I transmit
Expletive spasms before you tumble
In blind abandon into my castle
Can't stand myself, throw me away
Better take what you can
I got a roving eye
You can't leave me wet
I said you better wring me dry
And baby do you think I made it with my most size
You better do what you what you're told
You better just get wise
Roving eye
And you're oh so dissolute
Don't you be so flattered if I think you're cute
There's only one of me
There's a million of you
If you can't fake it
I said anyone else will do
Roving eye
I don't trust my intuition
I don't place any bets
Don't ask nothing from no one
My feelings never connect
I don't believe in a better world
Baby I'm stuck with you
Cause I'd rather take my turn
I've been washed out and left to dry
There's nothing left for you to buy
I only want what's dry and smooth
I only like things twice removed
I devoured you before but I've gone sour
You want more, I blame my nerves
I'm a lot but I deserve what I got
So you better hold me at bay
Erase me for another day
And when it's time to send me home
I'll drain your eyes and claim your bones
You are the Marquis de Sade
You want your guns to go pop
You want your hot boys and chocolate centres
I can't, no I won't
I love to talk
So if you want me to walk you better find the spot that's not tender
I'm not a bedroom athlete
Baby I'm not toilet trained
I need to put you out
I need to be restrained
If you want quick service
You better use a pump
If you like hard wood
You better better, ah, you better use a stump
Hit me
Girl you're polished to a high gloss
You want someone to play boss
You want to tell me what orders to give you
I can't wear your disguise
I'm too over-officialised
I won't be your slave unless you will be mine
I'm not a bedroom athlete
Baby I'm not toilet trained
I need to stretch you out
I need to be restrained
If you want quick service
You better use a pump
If you like hard wood
You better better, ah, you better use a stump
Hit me
Efficiency and progress is ours once more
Now that we have the Neutron bomb
It's nice and quick and clean and gets things done
Away with excess enemy
But no less value to property
No sense in war but perfect sense at home
The sun beams down on a brand new day
No more welfare tax to pay
Unsightly slums gone up in flashing light
Jobless millions whisked away
At last we have more room to play
All systems go to kill the poor tonight
Gonna kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night
While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
Behold the sparkle of champagne
The crime rate's gone, feel free again
Oh life's a breeze with you, Miss Lily White
Jane Fonda on the screen today
Convinced the liberals it's okay
So let's get dressed and dance away the night
While they kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor
Kill kill kill kill kill the poor tonight
I don't need your way of life
I can't stand your attitudes
I can do without your strife
I don't need this fucking world
I don't need this fucking world
This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to death
It seems so unreal to me
So much hate and so mouch pity
I can't take another day
It's such a bore
It gets me really sore
I don't need this fucking world
I don't need this fucking world
This world brings me down
Gag with every breath
This world brings me down
I'm looking forward to death
Looking forward to death
Are you believing the morning papers?
War is coming back in style
There's generals here, advisors there
And Russians nibbling everywhere
The chessboard's filling up with red
We make more profits when we blow off their heads
Economy is looking bad
Let's start another war when ya get drafted
Fan the fires of racist hatred
We want total war when ya get drafted
Drooling fingers
Panic buttons
Playing with missiles like they're toys
There's easy money, easy jobs
Especially when you build the bombs
That blow big cities off the map
Just guess who profits when we build 'em back up
Yeah, what Big Business wants Big Business gets
It wants a war  when ya get drafted
Trilateral Commission goonies laugh
and scheme for more  when ya get drafted
Call the Army!
Call the Navy!
Stocked with kids from slums  when ya get drafted
If you can't afford a slick attorney
We might make you a spy
Forget your demonstrations
Kids today sit on their ass when ya get drafted
Just a six-pack
And you're happy
We're prepared
For when ya get drafted
The Landlord's here to visit
They're blasting disco down below
Sez, "I'm doubling up the rent
Cos the building's condemned
You're gonna help me buy City Hall"
But we can, you know we can
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man
I tell them 'turn on the water'
I tell 'em 'turn on the heat'
Tells me 'All you ever do is complain'
Then they search the place when I'm not here
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord
Let's lynch the landlord man
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen
Roaches up to my knees
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau, yeah
Til the rain pours thru the ceiling
But we can, you know we can
Let's lynch the landlord man
I don't want to think
Don't make me care
I wanna melt in with the group
I need the balls
To leap out of my shell
And let go with my friends
Can't come up with anything I want to do
I need a project I can finish
My brain needs some stimulation
DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME
I'm so fucking tired
I gotta stay awake
I'm runnin' late
I gotta make it thru the day
And make my time go by
TV and the stereo and girls are lots of fun
I want the max
I relate better loaded
'Gotta see that movie stoned'
DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME
Drug me with natural vitamin C
Drug me with pharmaceutical speed
Drug me with your sleeping pills
Drug me with your crossword puzzles
Drug me with your magazines
Drug me with your fuck machines
With a fountain of fads
More rock and roll ads
DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME ME ME
Finally off of work
Unwind and watch the ball game at the bar
Another potato chip weekend
Is here at last
Go away Go away Go away Go away Go away
Leave me alone
So I can't see myself
DRUG ME DRUG ME DRUG ME
Your mommy told you this
And your daddy told you that
Always think like this
And never do that
You learned so many feelings
But what is there to that
Which are really yours
Or are you just a copycat
Your school told you this
And your church told you that
Memorize this
And don't you dare look at that
...
Just a tape recorder
Mimicking of the bores
You're so boring boring boring
Always tape machine recording
You're so boring boring boring
I've heard all this before
Planless and mindless
Scraps from anywhere
Bunch of used parts
From garbage pails everywhere
Frankenstein became a monster
Just like you
Your scars only show
When someone talks to you
You're so boring boring boring
Always tape machine recording
You're so boring boring boring
I've heard all this before
I've heard all this before
I've heard all this before
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster
Your emotions make you a monster
Down at the arsenal they keep the nerve gasses
Guarded day and night by caged white rabbits
Been sitting there for years
I'm gonna have at it
I cut through the fence, run right in and grab it
Go crazy crazy crazy crazy:
Now I got my own mustard gas in my pocket
Climb on a tree on a branch and drop it
On a country club full of Saturday golfers
So I can watch them die chokin' shakin'in convulsions
Go crazy crazy crazy crazy
Crazy crazy crazy crazy:
Chemical Warfare Chemical Warfare
Chemical Warfare Warfare Warfare
Panic in the air
See the headless chickens runnin'
Golf carts head on crashin'
Crackin' heads wide open
Scratch the grass, mister, you can't breath
And roll and writhe in a sandtrap
Starting to heave
Claw those clubs, lemme see you seethe
Crazy Crazy Crazy Crazy Crazy Crazy
Chemical Warfare Chemical Warfare
Chemical Warfare Warfare Warfare
Yellow air
Yellow clouds
Blowin' down down down the fairway
Sensitive to the touch
Mowin' down the putting green
Heading straight for the big clubhouse
Where the stuffed country club
Effervescent ladies, so carefree
Relax, pose by the pool
Limber limp with a dry martini
Until
I am Governor Jerry Brown
My aura smiles
And never frowns
Soon I will be president...
Carter Power will soon go away
I will be Fuhrer one day
I will command all of you
Your kids will meditate in school
Your kids will meditate in school!
California Uber Alles
California Uber Alles
Uber Alles California
Uber Alles California
Zen fascists will control you
100% natural
You will jog for the master race
And always wear the happy face
Close your eyes, can't happen here
Big Bro' on white horse is near
The hippies won't come back you say
Mellow out or you will pay
Mellow out or you will pay!
Now it is 1984
Knock-knock at your front door
It's the suede denim secret police
They have come for your uncool niece
Come quietly to the camp
You'd look nice as a drawstring lamp
Don't you worry, it's only a shower
For your clothes here's a pretty flower.
DIE on organic poison gas
Serpent's egg's already hatched
You will croak, you little clown
When you mess with President Brown
When you mess with President Brown
I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
Crush 'em under my car
I wanna hear them scream
Feed 'em poison candy
To spoil their Halloween
So your're in the kids' ward
You're in there cos you're ill
How about some Pavulon
So I can see you chill
Time to hit the scool bus
I think I'll shoot the tires
Offer them a helping hand
Of open telephone wires
Ever wanted to die?
Of course you have
But I won't till I get my revenge
I don't wanna see people any more
Things I never ever saw before
Make me see them for the shit they are
Take as many as I can away with me
Anyone can be king for a day
So I kill children
I love to see them die
I kill children
And make their mamas cry
I bang their heads in doors
I kill children
Can hardly wait for yours
We ain't going to the party
We ain't going to the game
We ain't going to the disco
Ain't gonna cruise down main
We're  stealing people's mail
stealing people's mail
stealing people's mail
On a friday night
Drivin' in the mountains
Winding 'round and 'round
Rummage thru your mailboxes
Take your mail back to town
And we got license plates, wedding gifts, tax returns
Checks to politicians from real estate firms
Money, bills and cancelled checks
Pretty funny pictures of your kids
We're gonna steal your mail
On a Friday night
We're gonna steal your mail
By the pale moonlight
We got grocery sackful after grocery sackful
After grocery sackful after grocery sackful
After grocery sackful after grocery sackful
Of the private lives of you
Ha Ha
People say that we're crazy
We're sick and all alone
But when we read your letters
We're rolling on the floor
We got more license plates, wedding gifts, tax returns
Checks to politicians from real estate firms
Money, bills and cancelled checks
We cut relationships with your friends
We're gonna steal your mail
On a Friday night
We're gonna steal your mail
By the pale moonlight
We better not get caught
We'll be dumped in institutions
Where we'll be drugged and shocked
'Til we come out born-again Christians
Sunny Sunday at the amusement park
See the fat kids spill their pop
Oh babe-lots of flags and balloons
But someone sabotaged the rollercoaster last night
Ran a turn and then it smashed right down
Thru the crowded haunted house below
Oh No
Human hamburger No
And it's  Crushed little Kids
Crushed little Kids
Crushed little Kids
Adorn the boardwalk
See the tourists drop their jaws and cones
See the owners smell a big lawsuit
Oh Police! (call your lawyer first)
Make the witnesses go home
And they'll turn on the TV
And see the crushed little kids
Adorn the boardwalk
In a desperate mind
Little gardens grow
They grow very wide
They grow very tall
Why am I alive
Urban Wonderland
By the fence I stand
In and out of hand
There are many paths
Dripping dark so dense
Do not enter here
Enter over there
People closing in
Barking at my mind
Shoving me to wine
I want all alone
I want my own home
I want my own girl
Help me hate the world
Own and love my life
So you been to school
For a year or two
And you know you've seen it all
In daddy's car
Thinkin' you'll go far
Back east your type don't crawl
Play ethnicky jazz
To parade your snazz
On your five grand stereo
Braggin' that you know
How the niggers feel cold
And the slums got so much soul
It's time to taste what you most fear
Right Guard will not help you here
Brace yourself, my dear
Brace yourself, my dear
It's a holiday in Cambodia
It's tough, kid, but it's life
It's a holiday in Cambodia
Don't forget to pack a wife
You're a star-belly sneetch
You suck like a leech
You want everyone to act like you
Kiss ass while you bitch
So you can get rich
But your boss gets richer off you
Well you'll work harder
With a gun in your back
For a bowl of rice a day
Slave for soldiers
'Til you starve
Then your head is skewered on a stake
Now you can go where people are one
Now you can go where they get things done
What you need, my son
What you need, my son
Is a holiday in Cambodia
Where people dress in black
Need a holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll kiss ass or crack
Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot
Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot, Pol Pot
It's a holiday in Cambodia
Where you'll do what you're told
A holiday in Cambodia
Where the slums got so much soul
Pol Pot
Twilight City gonna set my soul
It's gonna set my soul on fire
Got a whole lot of money that's ready to burn
So get those stakes up high
There's a thousand pretty women waiting out there
They're all waiting, they'll never make air
And I'm just the devil with a lung to spare, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
How I wish that there were more
Than the 24 hours in the day
Even if I ran out of speed, boy
I wouldn't sleep a minute of the way
Oh that blackjack and poker and the roulette wheel
I'll poach your money lost on every deal
All you need is sonar and nerves of steel, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Where the neon signs flash your name
The one-arm bandits cash in
All soap's down the drain
Viva Las Vegas
Turning day into nighttime
Turning night into daytime
If you see it once
You'll never be the same again
Gotta keep on running
Gonna have me some money
If it costs me my very last dime
If I wind up broke
Then I'll always remember that
I had a swingin' time
Oh, I'm gonna give it everything I've got
Lady Luck's with me, the dice stay hot
Got coke up my nose to dry away the snot, so
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva Las Vegas
Viva, viva Las Vegas
Almost ready, almost there,
Or is it already over?
She's a friend in need; she's a friend indeed,
Needs someone to hold her.
Alone at night, she plans her game,
Correctly thinking that I'm in pain,
Every night, it's all the same.
She's been a-fuckin' with my brain.
She don't need no one.
She don't need no one.
We all wanna play your game with you.
We know you're just a starter.
There's no reason for you to quit
Just because we try harder.
I don't wanna talk on the telephone.
I don't wanna see no pictures.
She'll find out just what she needs.
When she does, I'll get her.
She feels safe when she's with him.
He'll never try anything with her.
Now, you know, girl, you're just what I want.
Are you gonna let it scare you?
I knew it would.
She don't need no one.
She don't need no one.
She don't need no one.
She don't need no one.
She don't need me.
Got your jourdache jeans
Got your pretty long hair
Dinner and a movie powder your nose
Take their honey for lay
Just like pay
You're just a human being on this planet
You're just flesh and blood like all the rest
You'll get old and have a wrinkled ass
Humans are ses I want to be a bear
I want to shit in the woods
In my cave hunt my prey
Could be you, I want to have food
Burgers not berries
Ladies are women but women are ladies
Got a baited hook you are calling it
Your cherry
You want to settle down
And you want to get married
I don't want to smell your muff
Think that I'm a loser,
'Cause now my pants are too low
Think that I'm a slob,
'Cause I got holes in my shoes
Think my cock is like,
Just like my dirty shirt
Well you can fuck off,
'Cause I'm working sixty a week
You think that life is really tough
When your daddy won't buy you a brand new car
Take a girl out, she won't fuck you,
You just bought her a gram of coke
Spent all your money on shitty coke
I'm not a loser!
That's right, I'm not a loser!
I'm not a loser!
Cruise down the boulevard wasting mommy's gas
While you're looking for some kicks on Friday night
Your only goal in life is to smoke a joint
And decide how you're gonna get laid tonight
You are a fucking son-of-a-bitch, you arrogant assholes
Your pants are too tight, you fucking homos
You suck, Mr. Buttfuck, you don't belong here
Go away, you fucking gay. I'm not a loser!
Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
They treat me like a tool
They take me for a fool
Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
Oh they're so fucking dense
They look into the past
For future reference
Parents, why won't they shut up?
Parents, they're so fucked up
They don't even know I'm a boy
Just treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy
Parents!
Parents!
Parents!
They don't even know I'm a boy
They treat me like a toy
But little do they know
That one day I'll explode
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I'll destroy
I am a boy and not a toy
I will kill and I will destroy
Parents!
Parents!
Parents!
Parents!
You beat up Fearl's bass player
You were all surfers last year
3 years ago it wasn't cool
You spit on me, but I'm no one
Eh, bobby pin had long hair
But you spit on Darby Crash
He had a fucking mohawk man
3 years ago
Forming in 1975
I'm a new waver
My girlfriend's a surfer
I'm no more a trendy than you are
And she's not going to fuck you anyways
Eh, it dosen't matter, you all suck
You don't know shit about punk rock
You're just a bunch of drug addicts
Screwing up what we call fun
I hate everything, that means you
I hate you more than I do
I got no time to sleep, time to get laid
I got a 2"x 2", but it dosen't matter
Fake hard core
You spit on urinals
Go shoot your M-16.
Go shoot your M-16.
Go shoot your M-16.
I'm not gonna live your American dream.
Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.
Shoot him; you're better than him.
Shoot him in the eye.
Shoot him; it gives you a thrill.
Just like as a kid, only now it's for real.
Army life is right for me.
Kill to save democracy.
Got a rebel in my sights.
Money's worth more than his life,
So kill; it's fun.
I'm not a punk; how can I be?
Show me the way to conformity.
Try to be different, but it's always the same.
End up playin' someone else's game.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
You used to walk by my side.
Now you see me comin', now you hide.
I see you here, I see you there.
I can see that you don't care.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.
I'm just a square goin' nowhere.
Square goin' nowhere.
My room's a mess, I don't care
Tired of sitting at my desk
You can't bother me
Man, I'm far away from you
Got to get away
You can't ruin my day
You can't tell me what to do
You can't make me think I love you
Shoot it in your arm, you can't hurt me
I'm on my way to Catalina
I'm not going to read your books
My tank's full of squid
And it's getting light
Whores, you can't make me want
I got all the fish I need
On the deck of my boat
You can't take my heart when I'm here
('Cause it's a) long swim home
For your cute little arms
I'll steal some gas, fix my motor
Turn on my Beatles tape
And get you out of my head
Ah yes, here I am, far away from everyone
And the only fish I smell
Is on the deck of my boat
Yeah, I want to go (I really want to go)
but my motor's broken
There's no scotch tape, I'm out of gas,
Looks like I'm stuck here
(Shit)Looks like I'm stuck here
I'll steal some gas, fix my motor
Turn on my Doors tape
And get you out of my head
Get you out of my head
Ah, head.
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
I want to be stereotyped
I want to be classified
I want to be a clone
I want a suburban home
Suburban home

Suburban home
I want to be masochistic
I want to be a statistic
I want to be a clone

I want a suburban home
Suburban home
Suburban home

Suburban home
Suburban home
I want to be stereotyped

Well the people walk all around
The thing on an island very far from here
They pay it homage like a god
And they paint it on each and every year
A sign for all it was given to us
And we all appreciate this bomb
The tourists don't know and never will
It has no use it's meaning is gone
The Statue of Liberty
And for united we stand
We all agree it's a mystery
But why'd they give it to us?
We still don't know just why it came
A present from god or by the rain
The crowds swarm wildly to see it's peak
When I watch I go insane
Why is it so important to them
What is the beauty they see in it
I don't know why I just accept it
I don't want it cause it makes me sick
Look out get out of my way
I'm going to the atomic cafe
I'm going to the atomic cafe
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl
Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow
I want to see you tonight
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl
Your face is white
Your hair is black
You'll probably stab me in the back
But that's the chance I'm gonna take
Don't say sayonara I want to see you tomorrow
I want to see you tonight
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl
East is east, west is west
Girls from the east are the best
They got more of what I'm lookin' for
Ahhhhhh!
Look out get out of way
I'm going to the atomic cafe
I'm going to the atomic cafe
You're a mystery to me kabuki girl
Do you know what I think about you?
Do you know what I feel is true?
Do you know what I think about her?
I know she thinks about me, I'm sure
I don't know why it's so, but it's true
So you know what I think about you
Do you know what you want me to do?
When you see me staring at you,
Do you know what I want you to do?
I don't know why it's so, but it's true
I don't want to have sex with you
I want to be your friend
I want to be with you
I want you to marry me
So you know what I think about you
Do you know that my speed is you?
I know I want you to be my wife
It's you and me for the rest of your life
Do you know what I think about you?
Why can't you see you torture me
You're already thinking about someone else
When he comes home
You'll be in his arms and I'll be gone
But I know my day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one
So now you wait for his spark
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
When he makes you cry
You know I'll be there
My day will come i know
Someday I'll be the only one
Call me selfish
Call me what you like
I think it's right
To want someone for all your own
And not to share her love
And I'll have my way
And won't have to say anyway
Cause I've got you
You don't stand a chance
So now you wait for his cock
You know it'll turn you on
He's gonna make you feel
The way you want to feel
When he starts to lie
When he makes you cry
You know I'll be there
My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one
My day will come
I know someday I'll be the only one
So now you want perfection
I see your self destruction
You don't know what you want
It's gonna take you years to find out
I'm not giving up
And when you've had enough
You'll take your bruised little head
And you'll come running back to me
You know that I'm gonna be the only one.
Running out of time again
Where did you go wrong this time?
When your problems overwhelm you
Go get drunk, it's party time
Take a Quaalude, relax your mind
Relax your body too
Run from your problems but you'll never get away
No one wants you, and you wonder why?
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight?
When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight?
You're running out of breath again
You're an old maid, but you're only 15
You're losing your little girl's charm
Cry all night but you'll never get it back
Don't be afraid, it's not too late
Save yourself, I need you here
Wearing off, wearing out
I can't think about it cause it makes me sick
Sitting there with your mouth full of beer
Your eyes are glazed, your face is red
Who's gonna pick you up and use you for tonight?
Not me, not me
When you're on the streets with a needle in your arm
Selling your body for another fix
Who's gonna pick you up and take you home with them tonight?
Not me, not me...
Wake up early, mad at you.
Go to school, but where are you?
You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.
Your mother told me last night on the phone.
Why'd you do it? Now I'm alone.
I would've helped you, would've done anything.
Taken you with me, or bought you a ring.
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
Now you're gone, and I'm alone!
You should've told me, I should've known,
But now you're gone, and I'm alone.
Your mother told me last night on the phone.
Why'd you do it? Now I'm alone.
I would've helped you, would've done anything.

I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no satisfaction
And I try and I try and I try t-t-t-t-try try
I can't no, I can't get me no
When I'm riding in my car
And a man comes on the radio
He's tellin' me more and more
About some useless information
Supposed to fire my imagination
I can't get no
No-no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no satisfaction
I can't get me no girl reaction
And I try and I try and I try t-t-t-t-try try
I can't no, I can't get me no
When I'm watchin' my TV
And a man comes on to tell me
How white my shirts could me
But he can't be a man 'cause he does not smoke
The same cigarettes as me
I can't get no
No-no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
And when I'm flying 'round the world
And I'm doin' this and I'm tryin' do that
And I'm trying to make some girl
Who tells me babybabybabybabybabybabybabybabybabybaby....
Better come back later next week
Can't you see I'm on a losing streak
I can't get no
No-no, no
Hey, hey, hey
That's what I say
I can't get no (satisfaction)
I can't get me no (satisfaction)

She was walking, all alone
Down the street, in the alley
Her name was Sally, I never touched her
She never saw it
When she was hit by, space junk
She was smashed by, space junk
She was killed by, space junk
In New York, Miami Beach
Heavy metal fell, in Cuba
Angola, Saudi Arabia
On Christmas Eve, said NORAD
A Soviet sputnik, hit Africa
India, in Venezuela
In Texas, Kansas
It's falling fast, Peru too
It keeps coming, it keeps coming, it keeps coming
And now I'm mad about, space junk
I'm all burned out about, space junk
Oooh walk and talk about, space junk
It smashed my baby's head, space junk
And now my Sally's dead, space junk
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
Happier than you and me
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
And it determined what he could see
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
One chromosome too many
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
And it determined what he could see
And he wore a hat
And he had a job
And he brought home the bacon
So that no one knew
He was a mongoloid, mongoloid
His friends were unaware
Mongoloid, he was a mongoloid
Nobody even cared

Evolving up from little snails

Think I got your dial tone
Think I got Billy Baxter's bone
Think I got a bubble-sac
I think I got a Big Mac attack
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way
There's too much paranoias
There's too much paranoias
My momma's afraid to tell me
The things she's afraid of
I been dipped in double meaning
I been stuck with static cling
Think I got a rupto-pac
I think I got a Big Mac attack
Hold the pickles, hold the lettuce
Special orders, don't upset us
All we ask is that you let us
Serve it your way
There's too much paranoias
There's too much paranoias
My momma's afraid to tell me
The things she's afraid of
Something about the way you taste
Makes me want to clear my throat
There's a method to your movements
That really gets my goat
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
Centered 'round long time ago
On your ability to torment
Then you took your tongs of love
And stripped away my garment
I looked for silver linings
But you're rotten to the core
I've had just about all I can take
You know I can't take it no more
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling
I've got a gut feeling
I've got a gut feeling, feeling

Gotta come back now, Jonee
Hey, come back, Jonee

You made her cry
Jonee, you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
Jonee went to the pawnshop
Bought himself a guitar
Now he's gonna go far
You gotta love 'em and leave 'em
Sometimes you deceive 'em
You made her cry
Jonee, you're bad
You're gonna make her sad
As for the teardrops
Jonee jumped in his Datsun
Drove out on the expressway
Went head-on into a semi
His guitar is all that's left now
He made her cry
And she calls his name
Jonee, you're to blame
Come back Jonee
Hey, come back Jonee
You've gotta come back now, Jonee, Jonee, Jonee

Shrivel up DEVO
Swung from a chandelier
My planet sweet on a silver salver
Bailed out my worst fears
'Cause man has to be his own saviour
Blind sailors
Imprisoned jailers
God tame us
No one to blame us
The sky is blue
My hands untied
A world that's true
Through our clean eyes
Just look at you
With burning lips
You're living proof
At my fingertips
Walked on a tidal wave
Laughed in the face of a brand new day
Food for survival thought
Mapped out the place where I planned to stay
All the way
Well behaved
Just in case
It slips away
The sky is blue
My hands untied
A world that's true
Through our clean eyes
Just look at you
With burning lips
You're living proof
At my fingertips
La la la la la la la la la la la la la

In an ice-capped fire
Of burning wood
In our world of wire
Ignite our dreams of starry skies
And you and me
As realised our bigger themes
Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Do or die
What's done is done
True beauty lies
On the blue horizon
Who or why
What's one is one
In pure disguise
Of vulgar sons
Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Whatever burns burns eternally
So take me in turns internally
When I'm on fire
My body will be
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
In an ice-capped fire
Of burning wood
In our world of wire
Ignite our dreams of starry skies
And you and me
As realised our bigger themes
Oh, take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Take me internally
Forever yours
Nocturnal me
Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I hope it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain endured
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Where are you
In shadows only I can see
Looking for hope
And you hope it's me
Tattered and torn and born to be
Building a world where we can
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Pure and to magnify
Here am I
Whole at last with a golden view
Looking for hope
And I know it's you
Splitting my heart
Cracked right in two
The pleasure of pain and joy
To purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Purify our misfit ways
And magnify our crystal days
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do do

Days
Froze to the bone in my igloo home
Counting the days 'til the ice turns green
You know when heaven and hell collide
There are no in-betweens
(I'm the yo-yo man)
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my headstone
Collecting the bones of my friend tonight
Sowing the seeds in a fruitless land
You know when prayers all hit the ground
There is no higher hand
(I'm the yo-yo man)
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my headstone
I'm the yo-yo man, always up and down
So take me to the end of your tether
(I'm the yo-yo man)
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my...
(I'm the yo-yo man)
Flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through my...
(I'm the yo-yo man)
And the flames on your skin of snow turn cold
(Always up and down)
Cold is the wind that blows through our headstones

Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me
Up in your arms
Too late to beg you or cancel it
Though I know it must be the killing time
Unwillingly mine
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
In starlit nights I saw you
So cruelly you kissed me
Your lips a magic world
Your sky all hung with jewels
The killing moon
Will come too soon
Fate
Up against your will
Through the thick and thin
He will wait until
You give yourself to him
Under blue moon I saw you
So soon you'll take me

Stab a sorry heart
With your favourite finger
Paint the whole world blue
And stop your tears from stinging
Hear the cavemen singing
Good news they're bringing
Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise shell
A longing for
Some fresher feeling
Belonging
Or just forever kneeling
Where is the sense in stealing
Without the grace to be it
Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise shell
Burning my bridges
And smashing my mirrors
Turning to see if you're cowardly
Burning the witches with mother religious
You'll strike the matches and shower me
In water games
Washing the rocks below
Taught and tamed
In time with tear flow
Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise shell
Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise
Seven seas
Swimming them so well
Glad to see
My face among them
Kissing the tortoise shell
I chop and I change and the mystery thickens
There's blood on my hands and you want me to listen
To brawn and to brain when the truth's in the middle
Born of the grain like all good riddles
B-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom
You kill when you talk and the enemy weakens
Your words start to walk when you're not even speaking
If my heart is a war its soldiers are bleeding
If my heart is a war its soldiers are dead
B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your king- kingdom kingdom kingdom
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
Do do do do do do do, do do do do do do do
I've lost and I've gained and while I was thinking
You cut off my hands when I wanted to twist
If you know how to dance to Boney Maroney
He's doing the ballet on both of his wrists
B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
Thy will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make it the most of
Your k-k- k- k- k- kingdom, king-k- k- k- k-
B-b-b-burn the skin off and climb the roof top
And I will be done
B-b-bite the nose off and make the most of
Your king- kingdom, kingdom, kingdom
(You're a bitter malignous person)
(And the death is well overdue)
(You suck the blood that kills you)
(You kiss the hand that hates you)
(You're a bitter malignous person)
(And your death is well overdue)
(Your sucking bitter pain)
All at sea again
And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain
To bathe me again
My ship's a sail
Can you hear its tender frame
Screaming from beneath the waves
Screaming from beneath the waves
All hands on deck at dawn
Sailing to sadder shores
Your port in my heavy storms
Harbours the blackest thoughts
I'm at sea again
And now your hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain
To bathe me again
My ship's a sail
Can you hear its tender frame
Screaming from beneath the waves
Screaming from beneath the waves...
All hands on deck at dawn
Sailing to sadder shores
Your port in my heavy storms
Harbours the blackest thoughts
All hands on deck at dawn
Sailing to sadder shores
Your port in my heavy storms
Harbours the blackest thoughts
All at sea again
And now my hurricanes have brought down this ocean rain
To bathe me again
My ship's a sail
Hear its tender frame
Screaming from beneath the waves
Screaming from beneath your waves
Screaming from beneath the waves
Screaming from beneath the waves
All hands on deck at dawn
Sailing to sadder shores
Your port in my heavy storms
Harbours the blackest thoughts
Call it a day
When night becomes our mad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window
Devils on my shoulder
So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
Hope if you'll see
The demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me
Angels on my shoulder
Call it a day
When night becomes our bad escape
Forgetting the things you mean to say
When all the right words come too late and
Everything falls out of place
Under the pillow
Out of the race
Out of the window
Devils on my shoulder
So, so happy
When happiness spells misery
And mister me hoping to be
Where ugliness meets beauty
And if you see'll see the demon in you
The angel in me
The jesus in you
The devil in me
The demon's in you
The devil's in me
Devil on my shoulder
Angels coming closer
I am a patient boy
I wait, I wait, I wait, I wait
My time is water down a drain
Everybody's moving
Everybody's moving
Everything is moving,
Moving, moving, moving
Please don't leave me to remain
In the waiting room
I don't want the news
(I cannot use it)
I don't want the news
(I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
(Tell me why)
Because they can't get up
(Ahhh... Come on and get up)
(Come on and get up)
But I won't sit idly by
(Ahhh...)
I'm planning a big surprise
I'm gonna fight
For what I want to be
And I won't make the same mistakes
(Because I know)
Because I know how much time that wastes
(And function)
Function is the key
Inside the waiting room
I don't want the news
(I cannot use it)
I don't want the news
(I won't live by it)
Sitting outside of town
Everybody's always down
(Tell me why)
Because they can't get up
(Ahhh... Come on and get up)
Up from the waiting room
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
Sitting in the waiting room
(Ahhh...)
(Tell me why)
Because they can't get up
Ahistorical -
you think this shit just dropped right out of the sky
My analysis:
it's time to harvest the crust from your eyes
To surge and refine,
to rage and define ourselves
against your line
So sorry friend, you must resign
You want to figure it out
we'll throw down, we'll throw down, we'll throw down
You want to figure it out
well throw down your bulldog front
Bold bold mouth talking not so bold
now that you've eaten your own
Lips flecked, mouth specked
you strip the skin right off of the bone
But I would never say
you act without precision or care, but
it's all attention to armor,
to the armor you wear so well
You want to figure it out
we'll throw down, we'll throw down
You want to figure it out
we'll throw down your bulldog front
You want to figure it out
You want to figure it out
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
Let's knock and check to see if there's somebody home
You want to figure it out
we'll throw down and we'll throw down
You want to figure it out
we'll throw down your bulldog front
You want to figure it out
You want to figure it out
You can't be what you were
So you better start being
just what you are
You can't be what you were
the time is now is running out
is running out
is running running running out
You can't be what you were
So you better start living the life
That you're talking about
You can't be what you were
The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement
It betrays a bad mind
The no movement, the no movement, the no movement
In a bad mouth
It betrays a bad mind
You're always talking talking talking talking talking shit now
but you will talk yourself down
you're going way down!
There's something acting on this body
Something goes in when nothing comes out
And someone's acting on this information
But nothing's registered from this location
From this site that I sense that I am, in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
I wanted a language of my own
My lips were sucked empty and I mouthed the lines
Of this crowd that surrounds me
Punctured and parceled I fold my hand
To this site that I sense that I am in asking
What is this burning in my eyes?
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
You've got your hands over your ears
You've got your mouth running on
You've got your eyes looking for something
That will never be found - like a reason
Good god I don't need a reason
I never thought too hard on dying before
I never sucked on the dying
I never licked the side of dying before
And now I'm feeling the dying
But you've got to...
Give me the shot
Give me the pill
Give me the cure
Now what you've done to my world
Why can't I walk down a street free of suggestion?
Is my body the only trait in the eye's of men?
I've got some skin
You want to look in
There lays no reward in what you discover
You spent yourself watching me suffer
Suffer you words, suffer your eyes, suffer your hands
Suffer your interpretation of what it is to be a man
I've got some skin
You want to look in
She does nothing to deserve it
He only wants to observe it
We sit back like they taught us
We keep quiet like they taught us
He just wants to prove it
She does nothing to remove it
We don't want anyone to mind us
So we play the roles that they assigned us
She does nothing to conceal it
He touches her 'cause he wants to feel it
We blame her for being there
But we are all guilty
I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes up, the tide rolls out
The trucks roll by the park still a park
Where children play and pick up stones
Anything to make them feel less alone - he's alone
His mind is his own town where all his thoughts run aground
They fall all over and down
I spent it all
On the bag
On the drag
The sun comes down, the tide rolls back
We crawl our way back to the house we call home
He holds his home in the palm of his hand
And he says, and he says
You are my everyone, you are my anyone
You are my anytime, you are my every time y
You are my everywhere...anywhere...
You make yourself so beautiful,
You make yourself so, so beautiful
And now I feel like I'm going,
I'm going to set myself on fire.
I'm going to set myself up at a window,
This margin walker wants a clear view,
This margin walker wants a clear shot,
and now I'm shooting it right on you.
Untraceable, untranslatable,
I can't explain all I ever wanted to do
Trajectory passing right through me
Threads my needle sends it right through you.
You make yourself so visible,
You make yourself so, so visible,
And now I feel like I'm in the tread of
some bastard jealousy.
Up here, above the avenue, up here, where
the things you do,
They lend me a problem with the language,
split my seams and then they drop in a fuse.
Yes I know this is politically correct
But it comes to you spiritually direct
An attempt to thoughtfully affect your way of thinking
That is if you believe in race
And that you were born in the right time or place
That is a thought about face your way of thinking
Your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found out a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction.
If you have to carry a gun
To keep your fragile seat at number one
This is a bullet you can't outrun...
Your way of thinking
So wait and see it's coming round
Conscripted through the lost and found
And still we find so tightly wound...
Your way of thinking your way of...
And the same could be said for all the people lying dead
For them to die was a distraction
And what they found a bit too late
Got covered up with all that hate
And now it's nothing but reaction
Action. Reaction. Action. Reaction.
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
We are consumed by society
We are obsessed with variety
We are all filled with anxiety that this world would not survive
We gotta put it out the sky is burning
We gotta put it out the water's burning
We gotta put it out the earth is burning
Outrage but then they say...
Anytime but now
Anywhere but here
Anyone but me
I've got to think about my own life
The world is not our facility
We have a responsibility
To use our abilities to keep this place alive
Right here right now
Do it. Now. Do it.
Somewhere in these private minds,
The last one comes just in time to clear out
The chambers and sew up the lips,
'Cause that's the price to pay for hoping every slips not a slide.
In other words not to get it wrong,
It's pointless to walk when it's past time to run.
Secured under the weight of watchful eyes,
Lulled to sleep under clear expansive skies.
Somewhere in these prying hearts
Conflicting histories tear us apart
And we hope we don't get what we deserve,
Hide behind the targets in front of all the people we serve.
Blood on the pedals, blood on the grips
Steel leveled, chest level smear
My lips let them slip into a
Smile because now after
awhile it's all we're seen to do.
'Cause the business is as business does
Trash is trash until it's sealed from above
and left on to the corner of your mind to disappear.
Lockdown the remains.
Machine works best when the machine's not shy,
Trash is trash but trash from cash must divide.
Body bent body doubled, dismissed by time
A 5 to 9 will serve the 9 to 5.
Lockdown the remains.
Words
Words and expressions
All these confessions
Of where we stand
How I see you
And you see me
Dedications of symmetry
Together we will be
forever.
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see it through
Stupid fucking words
They tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
There were no truer words than when spoken
Let that stand as it should
There was nothing left when broken
We grab anything when we fall
Promises are shit
We speak the way we breathe
Present air will have to do
Rearrange and see us through
Stupid fucking words
They tangle us in our desires
Free me from this give and take
Free me from this great debate
You will do what you do
I will do what I do
We will do what we do
Rearrange and see it through
Go where you think you want to go
Do everything you were sent here for
Fire at will if you hear that call
Touch your hand to the wall at night
Promises.
Words.

The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Ideal love, a new purchase
A market of the senses
Dream of the perfect life
Economic circumstances
The body is good business
Sell out, maintain the interest
Remember Lot's wife
Renounce all sin and vice
Dream of the perfect life
This heaven gives me migraine
The problem of leisure
What to do for pleasure
Coercion of the senses
We are not so gullible
Our great expectations
A future for the good
Fornication makes you happy
No escape from society
Natural is not in it
Your relations are of power
We all have good intentions
But all with strings attached
Repackaged sex keeps your interest

The change will do you good
I always knew it would
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The sins of the flesh
Are simply sins of lust
Sweat's running down your back
Sweat's running down your neck
Heated couplings in the sun (Or is that untrue?)
Colder couplings in the night (Never saw your body)
Your kiss so sweet
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good
Damaged goods, send 'em back
I can't work, I can't achieve, send me back
Open the till, give me the change you said would do me good
Refund the cost, you said you're cheap but you're so smart
Your sweat so sour
Sometimes I'm thinking that I love you
But I know it's only lust
The change will do you good
I always knew it would
You know the change will do you good
You know the change will do you good
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
I'm kissing you goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk of blood and iron
Is the 'cause of all my shaking
All this talk about blood and iron
It's the 'cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to die for
It makes me want to run out shaking
I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something we can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt
I'm hearing talk of joy in labour
I'll tell you this, you can leave me out
The motherland's no place to cry for
I want some sand to hide my head in
I'm hearing talk of strength in labour
That's something I can do without
If I'm only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt
All this talk of blood and iron
It's the 'cause of all my shaking
The fatherland's no place to cry for
It makes me want to run out shouting
I hear some talk of guns and butter
That's something I can do without
If men are only blood and iron
O Doctor Doctor, what's in my shirt?
Just keep quiet, no room for doubt
Aim for the body rare, you'll see it on TV
The worst thing in 1954 was the bikini
See the girl on the TV dressed in a bikini
She doesn't think so, but she's dressed for the H-bomb
(For the H-bomb)
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
Aim for the country fair, you read it in the paper
The worst thing happens any week, a scandal on the front page
You see the happy pair smiling close like they are monkeys
They wouldn't think so, but they're holding themselves down
(Hold themselves down)
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
Aim for politicians fair who'll treat your vote hope well
The last thing they'll ever do, act in your interest
Look at the world through your polaroid glasses
Things'll look a whole lot better for the working classes
(Working classes)
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
I found that essence rare, it's what I looked for
I knew I'd get what I asked for
Look through the window
Look through the window
Look through the window
I'm looking through a pane of glass
Look through the window and what do you see?
Look through the window and what do you see?

I'm looking through a pane of glass
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
I'm so restless
We talk about this and we talk about that
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
I'm so restless, I'm bored as a cat
We talk about this and we talk about that
Light myself

Nicotine really goes to my head
Light myself up a cigarette
Light myself up a cigarette

Nicotine really goes to my head
If you're feeling all in take some asprin
If you feel in a mess put your head on a head rest
Your back on a back rest, foot on a foot rest
Or your arm on an arm rest or your leg on a leg rest
Your back on a back rest, if you feel in a real mess
When you're feeling all in
Take some asprin
Or some paracetamol
Always thought life should be so easy
It seems that I have misunderstood
Nothing I do can seem to please me
What I say don't sound so good
I always thought
I always thought
I always thought
It seems that I have misunderstood
The same again, another disagreement
You dreamed of scenes like you read of in magazines
A new romance, invented in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
The same again, another disappointment
We couldn't perform in the way the other wanted
These social dreams put in practise in the bedroom
Is this so private, our struggle in the bedroom?
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Our bodies make us worry
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?
Is this really the way it is?
Or a contract in our mutual interest?

Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cover
All the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket
At home she's looking for interest
At home she's looking for interest
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process
She said she was ambitious
So she accepts the process
Down on the disco floor
They make their profit
From the things they sell
To help you cob off
And the rubbers you hide
In your top left pocket
Two steps forward

How can I sit and eat my tea
With all that blood flowing from the television
At a quarter to six, I watch the news
Eating, eating all my food
As I sit watching the red spot
In the egg which looks like
All the blood you don't see on the television.
Still body now, no movement yet
Five men lie die flat on their backs
Were they born to lie in state
Defend the ever stagnate great?
Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Ionic charge gives immortality
The corpse is a new personality
Down on the street assassinate
All of them look so desperate
Declared blood war on the bourgeois state
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality
Watch new blood on the 18 inch screen
The corpse is a new personality

Woke up this morning desperation a. m
What I've been saying won't say them again
My head's not empty, it's full with my brain
The thoughts I'm thinking
Like piss down a drain
And I feel like a beetle on its back
And there's no way for me to get up
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Ought to control what I do to my mind
Nothing in there but sunshades for the blind
Only yesterday I said to myself
The things I'm doing are not good
For my health
"Love crops up quite a lot as something to sing about
Cos most groups make most of their songs about falling in love
Or how happy they are to be in love
You occasionally wonder why these groups do sing about it all the time -
It's because these groups think there's something very special about it
Either that or else it's because everybody else sings about it and always has
You know to burst into song you have to be inspired
And nothing inspires quite like love
These groups and singers think that they appeal to everyone
By singing about love because apparently everyone has or can love
Or so they would have you believe anyway
But these groups seem to go along with what, the belief
That love is deep in everyone's personality
I don't think we're saying there's anything wrong with love
We just don't think that what goes on between two people
Should be shrouded with mystery."
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Love'll get you like a case of anthrax
And that's something I don't want to catch
Standing in the line we're abberations
Defects in a defect's mirror
And we've been here all the time
Real fixations
Hidden deep in the furor-
What we do is secret-secret!
We're influential guys for the D.C.C
We can lie so perfect
And we've got a party line
To every call
It's a very short circuit-
What we do is secret-secret!
Licensed to drill with the torch
In our lives
Walking on shallow water
Progressed to the
Point of no distinction
Dementia of a higher order-
What we do is secret-secret!
I'm looking through
Communist eyes
I'm seeing planes in bloodshot skies
I see the flag of a working people
Who conceal the lies in the stars
And sickle
It's a double edge
Communist eyes-c'mon inside
I can't ever find the way out
Communist eyes-lost inside
I never get a day out
I'm looking through Communist eyes
All I see is an old man's alibi
There's a world outside
But I'm unaware
I open my books but the pages stare
It's a double edge
Communist eyes-all so blind
I can't even play the game now
I'm living through Communist times
I wave my flag and hold me head high
I can feel the glory of my
Comrades in masses
But I'm waiting for the day
When this madness passes
It's a double edge...
Land of treason-waste no reason-
We are breathing fire
We're packs of dogs-
We're enemies of men-we are not desired
Our face show-
We've grown cold-but
Have not conspired
Old hearts gone-
The future's on-mother nations mired
I like a recepticle for the chosen dead
We find our bodies clawed
And with the scent of death
We find that we are not so very awed
Loyalties burned-
The words our blurred-overturn your own
Walk like dogs and watch the doors-
Have your other stone
Stop the toys that match disordered-
Calculate the thrones
Feel the pulse descending-
Decaying hallowed tomes
In the starving sense you worship-
The nations of debris
You wear a cost of sewage-
That you've never ever seen
The time is now-the vicious here-
A stolen dinner code
The license of the savage land-
That you've always sold
So bite the hand that needs you
And bless another coal
The virus never issues-
From a cotton so very old
As the lights come down
You wash your hands and start to climb
The ladder that you stole
Slip the hatch-and spin the sword-
The money lords are poor
Push the tan-that rolls downhill-
Their sense of dream absorbed
Still the cat that breaks the night-
Tie him to the core
Chase the viruses that believe-
That what's right is scored
It's a senseless cash in of right for right-
What's wrong is never gone
And left is just a bastion for the fools
Golden dawn
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns
He sits in his corner like a child despised
A crazy sort of cast comes over his eyes-
That's Richie Dagger's crime
He's that sort of boy that was never much loved
His idea of fun was society's grudge-
That's Richie Dagger's crime
His life was such a mess
And his friends weren't quite the best
But he was satisfied-
That's Richie Dagger's crime
Suck me in and spit me out
Devour me in haste-
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns
He could set your mind ablaze
With sparkling eyes and visionary case
He stood like a remnant from an outbreak past
Wore something in his ear
And boy was he sass-
I'm Richie Dagger
I can stomp and swagger
I can take on all your heroes
I'm Richie Dagger
I'm young and i'm haggard
The boy that nobody owns
Billy Druids face is marble
He keeps every thought in its place
He lets the days turn tomorrow
Someone's always walking
On his grave
He wears the lines just like Garbo
And talks at a saturmine pace
Listening to the strange notes marvel
Only giving what it takes
It's a sad man's world
And for Billy it's sure to crown
Dragging beauty into darkness
Inflicting a pale white frown
And the matter the runs
Through Billy's head
Is too concerned to fall
Looking for a way out
I put my foot out of line
Really like to break-out
I feel so confined
American leather
The poisonous members
Not alone, not together
Their American leather
Saw you on a dark road
Brought myself along
Got a sense of conflict
But I know what's wrong
American leather
The poisonous members
Not alone-not together
Their American leather
I know that kinda feeling
So I built my place up high
But you'll never find me kneeling
Cause I'm too occupied
American leather
The poisonous members
Not alone-not together
Their American leather
I'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future, the world's my aim, so
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme that
I want toy tin soldiers that can push and shove
I want gun boy rovers that'll wreck this club
I'll build you up and level your heads
We'll run it my way, cold men and politics dead
I'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future, the world's my aim
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme that
I'll get silver guns to drip old blood
Let's give this established joke a shove
We're gonna wreak havoc on this rancid mill
I'm searchin' for something even if I'm killed
I'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future, the world's my aim
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme that
Empty out your pockets, you don't need their change
I'm giving you the power to rearrange
Together we'll run to the highest prop
Tear it down and let it drop away
I'm a lexicon devil with a battered brain
Searching for a future, the world's my aim, so
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme your hands, gimme, gimme your minds
Gimme, gimme this, gimme, gimme that
I came into this world like a puzzled panther
Waiting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed
I crossed the paths of right and wrong -
And saw them take their toll
I saw armies that marched
And like animals they crawled
I came into this world like a puzzled panther
Wanting to be caged
But something stood in the way
I was never quite tamed
Evolution is a process too slow
To save my soul
But I've got this creature on my back
And it just won't let go
If I am only an animal
Then I can do no wrong
But they say I'm something better
So I've gotta hold on
Clara would be proud to know us
We've taken it to the end
Where the grey turns to black
And the white just begins-
We live everyday on the water
The night just kills the pain
From the suffering that was
We are no stronger-we are dust-
Down in the crowd we're down
On our knees
Wanna get out but
Don't wanna succeed
We're the red-eyed legends
Of the night before
We're the dead mind babies
Of the T.V. war-
Living in a rectory of sin
Against the currents we all swim
Cageless wonders of sometime when
The paper icon's chase will end-
It's Sunday and the streets aren't clear
The traffic's screaming
But we can't hear
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
The sounds, the metals
Driving us mad
Driving us mad, oh
Driving us mad
We must bleed, we must bleed
We must bleed, we must bleed
The crash as the bottle breaks
Flashes it will through my veins
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
The pain, the colors
Making me sane
We must bleed, we must bleed
We must bleed, we must bleed
Night man, feels so right
Something scorching, fight
Touch the fear, clutch my sight
Touch the fear, clutch my sight
Touch the fear, clutch my sight
Touch the fear, clutch my sight
We must bleed
We must bleed
We must bleed
We must bleed
I'm not one I'm two, I'm not one
I'm two, I'm not one I'm two
I want out now, I want out now
I want out now now now now now
Now now now...
I've got television
I've got supervision
No decisons for you
Media blitz-media blitz
Immediate hits-we rule
Don't steal your eyes off the TV screen
Can you realize we're what we've seen
Take an injection from the mad machine
Don't read the papers read between the lines
We're vision rapers and we seed the signs
You'll play your part in the master mind
We feed the science
We deal in riots
We play by ideal time
We're a government fix
All social convicts
Watch the idle rhymes
Bleed your heart out-that's all it's worth
Before you ever start-we planned it first
Forget the truth-accept your curse
I feel your body's close to mine
I hear your breath and mine in time
I know I'm nothing but it's you that I need
I touch your skin and it starts to feed
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
My eyes meet yours in secret glance
Our bodies look in ancient stance
You whisper something and I know it's good
You're acting crazy just like I knew you would
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
Embracing my life between your thighs
We will perform in the deadly skies
Reducing my mind to endless nights
You send my dreams to their demise
Realized by your last breath
I take your hair into my hands
I pull it tight to fill your demands
I feed my body into yours
I know it's right cause that's my soul you stir
You're not the first you're not the last
Another day another crash
Out on the streets what ya lookin' for
That thing in your bed's just another whore
That tear in your eyes not a tear at all
For that girl that you touch you could never fall
That stream in your mind it's a tearin' sty
Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
Your leather is tight but you wear it full
'Gether is right but you gotta be cool
You cut your wrists but you don't feel the pain
You change your mind but you still feel the same
To dream ain't your kind just another lie...
Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
Sell us a story that we can believe
Spend your dollars on pills for relief
Love is a future that you still can't see
Standing answers to questions are free
Scream in your boredom life's just to die
Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
Dive in problems just like stealin' a fix
Is your life to live or is it for kicks
Kick dirt in the faces of angry dream men
Stand on your chairs and spell don't let me in
Don't stand in the light cuz you know you can't cry
Let's pretend you're vicious
Let's pretend you're cool
Let's pretend suspicious
Let's pretend you're fools
You walk to the temple on the boulevard
You know the way in cause you're
The son of God
She opens the door with
A sardonic glance
You drop to the floor making your plans
It's a real cool parody
That's my dragon lady
In a low society with no variety
She lives a tongue on cheek dream
There's something in her eyes
That nature denied
She's a whirlwind creature of cultural ties
A preacher of schemes and self denial
She talks up a storm with news and belial
To live in Braham tragedy
Driven it seems by fantasies
A life like this is sad to see
A smile kept quite in reverie
The clock on the matle hands stop crossed
The rug on the floors a resting place for the dust
The talk of the town yet she's never been seen
A loving relation with a well trained machine
It starts in your head
And moves to your hands
Your body starts shakin'
'Cause you're in demand
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can...
You're lashed 'twixt the stars
With your ice and motor cars
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can
Oh yea! Yea! Pull out the zen
I've got a Buddhist principle in my hand
Your life seems wasted your bodies laced in
Don't stop now you've got to trace it...
You put your hands together
Writhe in the shackle
You twist your body round
'Til it starts to crackle
You do the slave to the beat
Of the neuro-sutra can can...
Right here right now shake it in and out some
Lights on off now make it spin and fight now
Let me touch the tips of inculcated desire
And brush the fettered veil away
Shut down in the depths I lay...
If you want nothin' then I've got nothin'
I'm your annihilation man
Lemme get control I've got your minds
Now I want
Your souls, lemme get control
I've got your minds
Now I want control, I need control...
If you want somethin' then
I've got somethin'
I'm your annihilation man...
Though your dark eyes
You can feel my
Every sin
When I walk right
Into a straight line
This world of yours
I got you caught in my eye, again
You're the fall guy
In the corner
Of my gloom
It feels like
Everything I see
Is nothing new
I got you caught in my eye, again
There's a door there
That opens
Without you
And the door lies
With its open keys
To my room
Flames of the torch light
Fill my thighs
And I crave fulfill
And I consume 'em
But I don't give
I got you caught in my eye, again
Something I learned today
Black and white is always gray
Looking through the windowpane
I'm not inside, oh, your brain
Something I learned today
Yield to the right-of-way
Stopping at a four-way sign
Someone else's rules, oh, not mine
Something I learned today
Never look straight in the sun's rays
Letting all the sunshine in
Can't remember where, oh, I've been
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
Something I learned today
I look at your house
I wonder what goes on inside
When you have to cry yourself to sleep tonight
Your parents fight
You don't know who's wrong or right
Have to cry yourself to sleep tonight
A broken home, a broken heart
When the two of them will have to part
It's a broken home, a broken heart
Now you know just how it feels
To have to cry yourself to sleep at night
I look at your house
Look at your window deep inside
Are you gonna cry yourself to sleep tonight
Your parents fight
You don't know who's wrong or right
Have to cry yourself to sleep tonight
A broken home, a broken heart
When the two of them will have to part
It's a broken home, a broken heart
Now you know just how it feels
To have to cry yourself to sleep at night
There are things that I'd like to say
But I'm never talking to you again
There's things I'd like to phrase some way
But I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you
I'm tired of wasting all my time
Trying to talk to you
I'd put you down where you belong
But I'm never talking to you again
I'd show you everywhere you're wrong
But I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you
I'm tired of wasting all my time
Trying to talk to you
Talking to you
I'm never talking to you again
I'm never talking to you
I'm tired of wasting all my time
Trying to talk to you
I picked up my belongings in a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
He said "The sky's the limit on this chartered trip away"
I guess I'd better stay
Out there on the desert, I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved
He said "The sky's the limit on this chartered trip away"
Guess I'd better stay away
I thought I owed myself a trip away
I wanted to go to places I have never been away
I looked at the pictures, imagine where they lay
Away on a beach by the sand, where their clothes all lay away
I picked up my belongings in a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
Horizon is oblivious, chartered trip away
Guess I'd better stay
Out there on the desert, I see trees on every wall
Nothing's ever solved
Horizon is oblivious, chartered trip away
Guess I'd better stay
I thought I owed myself a trip away
I wanted to go to places I have never been away
I looked at the pictures, imagine where they lay
Away on a beach by the sand, where their clothes all lay away
I picked up my belongings in a nylon carry-all
I hear the porter call
Said "There's no returning from this chartered trip away"
I guess I'd better stay
Said "There's no returning from this chartered trip away"
Said "There's no returning from this chartered trip away"
Said "There's no returning from this chartered trip away"
Said "There's no returning from this chartered trip away"
Questions like a candle that's burning at both ends
Never find an answer that fits in your plans
Back and forth between the good and the bad
It's indecision time
You're so natural, you're so free
So don't decide what's best for me
Nothing in your life is ever going on course
You wonder if living could be much worse
Back and forth between the good and the bad
It's indecision time
You're so natural, you're so free
So don't decide what's best for me
Go to the left, go to the right
Your mind is going to keep you up all night
You twist in your sleep, grabbing the sheets
Sweating to death
Sucking on pollution like a rattle in your mouth
You're a big fucking kid, you don't know what you're about
Back and forth between the good and the bad
It's indecision time
You're so natural, you're so free
So don't decide what's best for me
Tell me about your fellow man
You wipe their shit all over your hands
Back and forth between the good and the bad
It's indecision time
You're so natural, you're so free
Go to the left, go to the right
Your mind is going to keep you up all night
You twist in your sleep, grabbing the sheets
Sweating to death
Krsna walking down the street
Touching me with lotus feet
Going to talk to the Radharani
Going to ask her for her money
Hare Krsna
Hare Krsna
Hare Krsna
Hare Krsna
Hare Krsna, Hare Krsna
Krsna Krsna, Hare Hare
Hare Rama, Hare Rama
Rama Rama, Hare Hare
...
It's a one-horse town
One big desert
Asphalt desert
Asphalt jungle
Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Change for the worse
Change nonetheless
Hey, hey, hey
Got no place to stay
Beyond the threshold
I hear machines
They burst at the seams
But tar and feather
All stick together
Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Greetings from home
I wish you were here
Hear what I say but
You can't hear me at all
Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Beyond the threshold
Beyond, beyond, beyond
Why did you back me into a corner?
I didn't mean it, it was just an act
My friend's outside, can't he come in?
And everybody else
Stupid pride, selfish pride, stupid pride
Pride pride pride
Why does everybody have to be like that?
"Out!" Just an act
His parents love him
They send him money
But he won't come back
Stupid pride, selfish pride, stupid
Pride pride pride
Why does everybody have to be like that?
No reaction, no response
Forget him, just forget him
Told you everything I knew about me
Didn't listen to a word I say
Spill my guts, you just threw them away
Never cared about me
Only wanted to be your friend
Now I know that it's gotta end
Never cared a thing about me
And now, I will, I will
I will never forget you
I will never forgive you
I will never forget you
I will never forget you
I will never forgive you
I will never forget you
You think you've made it to the top because people know your name
It's still the same
Your daydreams aren't forever, you better get your shit together
For a new game
Back to your day job
Back to your girlfriend
Back to your hometown
The biggest lie
Passing harsher judgement, but you brought it on yourself
By being you
You trade your respect for no success, you tried to be a hero
But you end up nothing
Back to your day job
Back to your girlfriend
Back to your hometown
The biggest lie
I was talking
When I should have been listening
I didn't hear a word that anyone said
It must not have been so very important
'Cause I was concerned about instead
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
I was talking
When I should have been listening
I didn't hear a word that anyone said
It must not have been so very important
'Cause I was concerned about instead
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
Inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on inside my head
What's going on
What's going on
Whaaaaaa
What's going on
Ugh
Can you feel it feel it feel it
In your soul
Can you tell me
Tell me if it's hot or cold
Can you tell me
What it is
Does it hurt you
When I do this
Stop it stop it stop it
You're pulling too hard
Stop it
You're going too far
Can you tell me
What it is
Does it hurt you
When I do this
Can you tell me
What it is
Does it hurt you
When I do this
I love it I hate it I love it
I hate it too
I love it I hate it I love it
So how about you?
Can you tell me
'Cause I don't know
Why don't you tell me
Why is it so
Confusing!
There was no one all around
There was no one there but me
I was staring out a window
I was standing by the sea
The waves kept on repeating
Each one crashing to the shore
And my footprints nowhere leading
As they disappeared once more
Your senses, they are bombarded
By the roaring that you hear
In a shell, you can hear the ocean
When you put it up, up to your ear
There was no one all around
There was no one there but me
I was staring out a window
I was standing by the sea
Searching for the truth but all I ever find is lies
Trying to find identity but I just find a disguise
Looking at the nightmare when I try to see the dream
Finding a reality as perfect as it seems
Somewhere the dirt is washed down with the rain
Somewhere there's happiness instead of pain
Somewhere satisfaction has no name
Somewhere I can be the same
Looking down on everything it seems a total bore
Missing all the people that I've never met before
Trying to find an unknown something I consider best
I don't know if I'll find it, but until then I'll be depressed
Somewhere the dirt is washed down with the rain
Somewhere there's happiness instead of pain
Somewhere satisfaction has no name
Somewhere I can be the same
Somewhere the dirt is washed down with the rain
Somewhere there's happiness instead of pain
Somewhere satisfaction has no name
Somewhere I can be the same
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere
Somewhere
Going out each day to score
She was no whore but for me
Celebrating every day
The way she thought it should be
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
She was always by my side
And never tried to leave
Standing up for me
And like a tree for what she believed
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
No more rope and too much dope
She's lying on the bed
Angels pacing gently placing
Roses 'round her head
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
And I don't know what to do
Now that pink has turned to blue
Now I don't know what to do
Been through mass destruction once, but once was not enough
Said we want a second chance, and all they say is tough
A world where science went too far, there's no way to survive
Why can't we get this thing straightened out, 'cause I want to stay alive
They burned and bombed the east and north and there's no place left to go
The sun belt's overcrowded, so let's annex Mexico
The peso's only worth a dime, but they've got all that land
There's no need for a civil war, we know they'll understand, right?
Is that how you like it?
Factories left unattended, crumbling to the ground
We tried to keep them running, but there's no more oil around
We used it all to fight a war that neither side could win
Vietnam was Little League compared to where we've been
Now we live in caves and huts, and we don't have pay TV
And everyone is signing up for the newest industry
Standard Oil goes solar power, all try to make a buck
I'll sit around and smoke cigarettes, and I'll babble "What the fuck?"
That's how I like it
We were just thinking about signing up for the newest industry
We'll sign up for the newest industry
Yeah, we'll sign up for the newest industry
Yeah, we'll sign up
He lives in his imagination, with those friends of his very own
He doesn't get along with the outside world, he'd rather be alone
Sometimes, when it's late at night, he starts to wonder why
The plans he made can never happen, so all he does is cry
His parents, they can't understand why their son, he turned out wrong
He runs away from all the pain and forgets them when he's gone
He'd rather be all by himself because his plans, they seem the best
He finally gets the nerve one day and now life becomes a test
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Mom and Dad, I'm sorry
Mom and Dad, don't worry
I'm not the son you wanted, but what could you expect?
I've made my world of happiness to combat your neglect
Mom and Dad, I'm sorry
Mom and Dad, don't worry
Mom and Dad, I'm sorry
Mom and Dad, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say
Whatever you want, whatever you do, wherever you go, whatever you say

Don't give up
Don't let go
Don't give in
Don't let on
In your bed
Late at night
Red hot red
Don't get up
If there's one thing that I can't explain
It's why the world has to have so much pain
With all the ways of communicating
We can't get in touch with who we're hating
(Who we're hating)
And now we can't get in touch with who we're hating
So turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
The news
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
The news
I hear it every day on the radio
Somebody shoots a guy he don't even know
Airplanes falling out of the sky
A baby is born and another one dies
Highways filled with refugees
Doctors finding out about disease
With all this uptight pushing and shoving
Keeps us away from who we're loving
(Who we're loving)
It keeps us away from who we should be loving
So turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
The news
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)
Turn on (turn on)

Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me reaching for the moon
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me playing the fool
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm an Idiot for you
Calling Sister Midnight
I'm a breakage inside
Calling Sister Midnight
Calling Sister Midnight
You know I had a dream last night
Mother was in my bed
And I made love to her
Father he gunned for me
Hunted me with his six gun
Calling Sister Midnight
What can I do about my dreams
Listen to me Sister Midnight
You put a beggar in my heart
Calling Sister Midnight
You've got me walking in rags
Hey where are you Sister Midnight
Can you hear me call
Can you hear me well
Can you hear me at all
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're what's happening
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're an ice machine
We see people brand new people
They're something to see
When we're nightclubbing
Bright-white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild?
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We're walking through town
Nightclubbing we're nightclubbing
We walk like a ghost
We learn dances brand new dances
Like the nuclear bomb
When we're nightclubbing
Bright white clubbing
Oh isn't it wild...
Fun

Fun

all aboard for funtime
Fun
Hey, I feel lucky tonight

Baby, don't you cry
Baby, I'll sing you a lullabye
We're walking down the
Street of chance
Where the chance is always
Slim or none
And the intentions unjust
Baby there's nothing to see
I've already been
Down the street of chance
Baby you're so clean
Baby please stay clean
Baby you're so young
Baby please stay young
Baby, don't you cry
Baby, we've already cried
I couldn't escape this feeling
With my China Girl
I'm just a wreck without
My little China Girl
I'd hear hearts beating
Loud as thunder
See the stars crashing
I'm a mess without
My China Girl
Wake up mornings, there's
No China Girl
I'd hear hearts beating
Loud as thunder
I'd see stars crashing down
I'd feel tragic
Like I was Marlon Brando
When I'd look at my China Girl
I could pretend that nothing
Really meant too much
When I'd look at my China Girl
I'd stumble into town
Just like a sacred cow
Visions of swastikas in my head
And plans for everyone
It's in the white of my eyes
My little China Girl
You shouldn't mess with me
I'll ruin everything you are
I'll give you television
I'll give you eyes of blue
I'll give you men who want to rule the world
And when I get excited
My little China Girl says,
"Oh Jimmy, just shut your mouth."
She says, "Shhhh..."
Things have been tough
Without the dum dum boys
I can't seem to speak
The language
I remember how they
Used to stare at the ground
They looked as if they
Put the whole world
Looked as if they put
The whole world down
The first time I saw
The dum dum boys
I was fascinated
They just stood in front
Of the old drug store
I was most impressed
No one else was impressed
Not at all
And we'd sing
Da-da-da-da-da-da
Dum dum day
Where are you now my
Dum dum boys are you
Alive or dead
Have you left me the last
Of the dum dum daze
Then the sun goes down
And the boys broke down
People said we were negative
They said we'd take but
We would never give
But we'd sing da-da-da
Da-da-da dum dum day
Da-da-da-da-da dum
And hope it would pay
Da-da-da-da it's been
A dumdumdum day
A dum dum day
Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
Where are you now
When I need your noise
Now I'm looking for
The dum dum boys
The walls close in and
I need some noise
Well the day begins
You don't want to live
'Cause you can't believe
In the one you're with
'Cause you know her tricks
And you know her past
When she makes a face
You just have to laugh
And you feel like such a know-it-all
When you only want just a tiny girl
And you hope she'll sing.
So you turn around
Toward the tiny girls
Who have got no tricks
Who have got no past
Yea that's what you think
And you hope she'll sing
But she sings of greed
Like a young banshee
And she wants for this
And she wants for that
What did you think.
Before you go
Do me a favour
Give me a number
Of a girl almost like you
With legs almost like you
I'm buried deep in mass production
You're not nothing new
I like to drive along the freeways
See the smokestacks belching
Breasts turn brown
So warm and so brown
Though I try to die
You put me back on the line
Oh damn it to hell
Back on the line--hell
Back on the line
Again and again
I'm back on the line
Again and again
And I see my face here
And it's there in the mirror
And it's up in the air
And I'm down on the ground
By the way
I'm going for cigarettes
And since you've gotta go
Won't you do me that favour
Won't you give me that number
Won't you get me that girl
Yeah, she's almost like you
Yes, she's almost like you
And I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yes, I'm almost like him
Yeah, I'm almost like him
I've been waiting for a guide to come and take me by the hand,
Could these sensations make me feel the pleasures of a normal man?
These sensations barely interest me for another day,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, take the shock away.
It's getting faster, moving faster now, it's getting out of hand,
On the tenth floor, down the back stairs, it's a no man's land,
Lights are flashing, cars are crashing, getting frequent now,
I've got the spirit, lose the feeling, let it out somehow.
What means to you, what means to me, and we will meet again,
I'm watching you, I'm watching her, I'll take no pity from your friends,
Who is right, who can tell, and who gives a damn right now,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
Until the spirit new sensation takes hold, then you know,
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling,
I've got the spirit, but lose the feeling.
Feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling, feeling.
This is the room, the start of it all,
No portrait so fine, only sheets on the wall,
I've seen the nights, filled with bloodsport and pain,
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.
Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?
These are your friends from childhood, through youth,
Who goaded you on, demanded more proof,
Withdrawal pain is hard, it can do you right in,
So distorted and thin, distorted and thin.
Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?
This is the car at the edge of the road,
There's nothing disturbed, all the windows are closed,
I guess you were right, when we talked in the heat,
There's no room for the weak, no room for the weak.
Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?
This is the room, the start of it all,
Through childhood, through youth, I remember it all,
Oh, I've seen the nights filled with bloodsport and pain,
And the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained, the bodies obtained.
Where will it end? Where will it end?
Where will it end? Where will it end?
Forced by the pressure,
The territories marked,
No longer the pleasure,
Oh, I've since lost the heart.
Corrupted from memory,
No longer the power,
It's creeping up slowly,
That last fatal hour.
Oh, I don't know what made me,
What gave me the right,
To mess with your values,
And change wrong to right.
Please keep your distance,
The trail leads to here,
There's blood on your fingers,
Brought on by fear.
I campaigned for nothing,
I worked hard for this,
I tried to get to you,
You treat me like this.
It's just second nature,
It's what we've been shown,
We're living by your rules,
That's all that we know.
I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you,
I tried to get to you.
Guess your dreams always end.
They don't rise up just descend,
But I don't care anymore,
I've lost the will to want more,
I'm not afraid not at all,
I watch them all as they fall,
But I remember when we were young.
Those with habits of waste,
Their sense of style and good taste,
Of making sure you were right,
Hey don't you know you were right?
I'm not afraid anymore,
I keep my eyes on the door,
But I remember...
Tears of sadness for you,
More upheaval for you,
Reflects a moment in time,
A special moment in time,
Yeah we wasted our time,
We didn't really have time,
But we remember when we were young.
And all God's angels beware,
And all you judges beware,
Sons of chance, take good care,
For all the people not there,
I'm not afraid anymore,
I'm not afraid anymore,
I'm not afraid anymore,
Oh, I'm not afraid anymore.
A change of speed, a change of style
A change of scene, with no regrets
A chance to watch, admire the distance
Still occupied, though you forget
Different colours, different shades
Over each mistakes were made
I took the blame
Directionless so plain to see
A loaded gun won't set you free
So you say
We'll share a drink and step outside
An angry voice and one who cried
We'll give you everything and more
The strain's too much, can't take much more
I've walked on water, run through fire
Can't seem to feel it anymore
It was me, waiting for me
Hoping for something more
Me, seeing me this time
Hoping for something else
Confusion in her eyes that says it all.
She's lost control.
And she's clinging to the nearest passer by,
She's lost control.
And she gave away the secrets of her past,
And said I've lost control again,
And of a voice that told her when and where to act,
She said I've lost control again.
And she turned around and took me by the hand
And said I've lost control again.
And how I'll never know just why or understand
She said I've lost control again.
And she screamed out kicking on her side
And said I've lost control again.
And seized up on the floor, I thought she'd die.
She said I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
Well I had to phone her friend to state my case,
And say she's lost control again.
And she showed up all the errors and mistakes,
And said I've lost control again.
But she expressed herself in many different ways,
Until she lost control again.
And walked upon the edge of no escape,
And laughed I've lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
She's lost control again.
She's lost control.
I could live a little better with the myths and the lies,
When the darkness broke in, I just broke down and cried.
I could live a little in a wider line,
When the change is gone, when the urge is gone,
To lose control. When here we come.
To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you,
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you,
I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you,
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth.
In the shadowplay, acting out your own death, knowing no more,
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor,
And with cold steel, odour on their bodies made a move to connect,
But I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left.
I did everything, everything I wanted to,
I let them use you for their own ends,
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you,
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you.
I travelled far and wide through many different times
What did you see there?
I saw the saints with their toys
What did you see there?
I saw all knowledge destroyed
I travelled far and wide through many different times
I travelled far and wide through prisons of the cross
What did you see there?
The power and glory of sin
What did you see there?
The blood of Christ on their skins
I travelled far and wide through many different times
I travelled far and wide and unknown martyrs died
What did you see there?
I saw the one sided trials
What did you see there?
I saw the tears as they cried
They had tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
Tears in their eyes
I walked through the city limits,
Someone talked me in to do it,
Attracted by some force within it,
Had to close my eyes to get close to it,
Around a corner where a prophet lay,
Saw the place where she'd a room to stay,
A wire fence where the children played.
Saw the bed where the body lay,
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
The cars screeched hear the sound on dust,
Heard a noise just a car outside,
Metallic blue turned red with rust,
Pulled in close by the building's side,
In a group all forgotten youth,
Had to think, collect my senses now,
Are turned on to a knife edged view.
Find some places where my friends don't know,
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
Down the dark streets, the houses looked the same,
Getting darker now, faces look the same,
And I walked round and round.
No stomach, torn apart,
Nail me to a train,
Had to think again,
Trying to find a clue, trying to find a way to get out!
Trying to move away, had to move away and keep out.
Four, twelve windows, ten in a row,
Behind a wall, well I looked down low,
The lights shined like a neon show,
Inserted deep felt a warmer glow,
No place to stop, no place to go,
No time to lose, had to keep on going,
I guessed they died some time ago.
I guessed they died some time ago.
And I was looking for a friend of mine.
And I had no time to waste.
Yeah, looking for some friends of mine.
We were strangers.
We were strangers, for way too long, for way too long,
We were strangers, for way too long.
Violent, violent,
Were strangers.
Get weak all the time, may just pass the time,
Me in my own world, and you there beside,
The gaps are enormous, we stare from each side,
We were strangers for way too long.
Violent, more violent, his hand cracks the chair,
Moves on reaction, then slumps in despair,
Trapped in a cage and surrendered to soon,
Me in my own world, the one that you knew,
For way too long.
We were strangers for way too long.
We were strangers,
We were strangers for way too long,
For way too long.
Man watching video
The heart keeps on ticking.
He doesn't know why
He's just cattle for slaughter.
The requiem
The requiem
The requieeeeeeeeeeeeeeeem
When the meaningful words
When they cease to function
When there's nothing to say
When will they start plotting against you
The requiem
The requiem
The requieeeeeeeeeeeeeem
Only a hint of religion
Uncensored truths for the novelty.
the sound of breaking glass
this is a reflection
The requiem
The requiem
The requiem
The
The atmosphere's strange
Out on the town
Music for pleasure
It's not music no more
Music to dance to
Music to move
This is music to march to
do a war dance
A war dance
Look at graffiti
Scrawled on the wall
You know the the reason
Outside the door
You got something
Nasty in your mind
Trying to get out
do a war dance
A war dance
You've opened the pit
Honesty is sick
You try to be honest
Look what you get
The foods run short
And then the money talks
One way out
Your premonition is correct
A war dance
Picture - sent back live
Picture - the golden age
Letter - on your doorstep
Called up - for your country
Never no I don't wanna - no
Horror - don't let me go on
Mommy - they'll take his pain away
Carry us - face the music
Called up - for your country
Never no I don't wanna - no
Take - aim - and - fire
Motives changing
Day to day
The fire increases
Mass decay
I look at the river
White foam floats down
The bodies poisoned
Gotta sit tight
The wait
After awakening
The silence grows
Screams subside
Distortion shows
Mutant thought
Of bad mouthed news
It's just another birth
Of distorted views
The wait
See the sun turn green
From my penthouse window
It's different now
Because you got no shelter
Alienation
By experimentation
Enjoy yourself
This is the new age
Complication
Ransom the birth
Of a new destruction
It's different now
It's what we always wanted
Alienation
Self-destruct
At the count of ten
Complication
See the sun turn green
From my penthouse window
It's different now
Because you got no shelter
Alienation
Enjoy yourself
This is your new age
Complication
One man limited room to think
move with the lines in soft fat red
phase one environment experiment
this is your city with miracles spent so dead
crime of flesh control is joyless
blue white shells will not grow to trees
phase one environment experiment
the smoke on the city with miracles spent so dead
Primitive feeling
Primitive way
Getting closer
To the primitive day
Intuition
Wherever it goes
The primitive day
The primitive way
Primitive feeling
Primitive way
Getting closer
To the primitive day
Follow the feeling
Wherever it goes
The primitive day
The primitive way
You see
You feel
You know
React
You're waiting
You're waiting
Change
I've got this bird's eye view
And it's in my brain
Clarity has reared
Its ugly head again
So this is real life
You're telling me
And everything
Is where it ought to be
I like your nerve
I like watching you
But I don't watch what I'm doing
Got better things to do
So this is real life
You're telling me
Now I'm lost in shock
Your face fits perfectly
I suspect you ain't so sweet
As the lust I'm concealing
My skin wants to crawl back home to Ma
I've lost my way in my feelings
You always collect your fists
When my shadow falls upon your hands
You're just giving body heat away
But they say you're a nice enough young man
I want to see you
Don't you won't to see me?
I'm full of questions
You're full of mystery
You can touch yourself anytime
You can touch yourself anytime
So wretched - you are so fetching
Stop smiling at me - treat me unpleasantly
You've got the whole world in your wardrobe
Your furniture's made to injure me
My skin will crawl back home to Ma
When our souls mingle uneasily
I want to see you ...
This and that, they must be the same
What is legal is just what's real
What I'm given to understand
Is exactly what I steal
I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I wormed my way into the heart of the crowd
I was shocked to find what was allowed
I didn't lose myself in the crowd
Shot by both sides
On the run to the outside of everything
Shot by both sides
They must have come to a secret understanding
New offences always in my nerves
They're taking my time by force
They all sound the same when they scream
They have to rewrite all the books again
As a matter of course
I wormed my way ...
Shot by both sides ...
'Why are you so edgy, Kid?'
Asks the man with the voice
One thing follows another
You live and learn, you have no choice
I wormed my way ...
Shot by both sides
I don't ask who's doing the shooting
Shot by both sides
We must have come to a secret understanding
We must have come to a secret understanding
Dashing through Paradise
So polite in what I say
Last in the one I'm in
I won't a world to give away
I know what's mine
You'll learn what's yours
I know what you want to see
You scratch my back
And I grow claws
Falling in love awkwardly
Dancing in my own good time
My words stick out of your face
If you're not feeling so weak today
Somebody will take your place
I know what's mine ...
Once you had this promise
On the tip of your tongue
But it went without saying
It went on too long
All the straws you clutched at
Have burst into flames
And so you smile that way
Tantalisingly lame
The smart ones understood
How your heart bursts
Like a bottle of champagne
Your just deserts
The smart ones understand
You shouldn't settle for less
You're gonna forget yourself
In my happiness
Keep your silence to yourself - in my happiness
You will forget yourself - in my happiness
I believe all that I read now
Night has come off the corners
Shadows flicker sweet end tame
Dancing like crazy mourners
The man with the hotdogs sells lemonade
Someone over there needs first aid
While me and the rest of the world
Await the touch of the motorcade
No one finds time to turn a blind eye
You can't be too careful nowadays
And my friend says 'listen..
To the stupid things they're making you say'
Here comes the motorcade
Moving so slow and hard
Like a snake in a closet
Holding sway in the boulevard
Here is your man
All faces turn unanimously
The small fry who sizzle in his veins
In all security
In the back of his car
Into the null and void he shoots
The man of the centre of the motorcade
Has learned to tie his boots
In the back of his car
In the null and void he sees
The man at the centre of the motorcade
Can choose between coffee and tea
In the boulevard - the motorcade hold sway
Laughter staggers on
In between their gags
Pounding their faces
He's on his last legs
I don't care to dance
I don't care to dance
I don't want to dance
I'm not going to dance
Angels twitch nervously
The brave and the bold weep
We all want to know who
We should pay tribute to
Hey good looker
Hey good looker
You could tell me all about it
Go on tell me all about if
I know your secrets
I know your secrets
You could tell
I may have lost the thread
I was supposed to pull
May I say everyone
Is irresistible
Everyone is irresistible
Now I'm not sure which way I should turn
I can say 'Now I've seen everything'
At last there must be no more to learn
That's what you want to hear
Sadly, also it's true
And I know all your ways
And I'm still hung up on you
Oh great beautician in the sky
Your innocence just saddens me
I shall throw it all against the wall
Take my pleasure in spite of if all
I know your secrets
Hey good looker
I could fall all night over you
Hey good looker
Roses are red, violets are blue
Time flies
Time crawls
Like an insect
Up and down the walls
The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me
The conspiracy
Of silence ought
To revolutionize
My thought
The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me
The cold light of day
Pours out of me
Leaving me black
And so healthy
The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me
It jerks out of me
Like blood
In this still life
Heart beats up love
The light pours out of me
The light pours out of me
They will show me what I want to see
We will watch without grief
We stay one step ahead of relief
You tell me we've been praying
For a bright and clever hell
I think we've been forced to our knees but I can't tell
Sometimes I forget that we're supposed to be in love
Sometimes I forget my position
It's so hot in here
What are they trying to hatch?
We must not be frail, we must watch
Now that I'm out of touch with anger
Now I have nothing to live up to
And I don't know when to stop joking
When I stop I hope I am with you
Sometimes ...
What on earth is the size of my life?
What happened to you?
You're not the same
There's something in your head
Made a violent change
It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head
Filler
You call it religion
You're full of shit
Filler
Was she really worth it?
She cost you your life
You'll never leave her side
She's gonna be your wife
It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head
Filler
You call it romance
You're full of shit
Filler
Your brain is clay
What's going on?
You picked up a bible
And now you're gone
It's in your head
It's in your head
It's in your head
Filler
You call it religion
You're full of shit
Filler
You never knew
You never will
Filler
You're another sheep
Looking for a shepherd
Filler
What is going on?
Filler
Filler, filler
Filler in your head
I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize
That I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
I don't want to hear it
All you do is talk about you
I don't want to hear it
'Cause I know that none of it's true
I don't want to hear it
I'm sick and tired of all your lies
I don't want to hear it
When are you gonna realize
That I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Shut your fucking mouth
I don't care what you say
You keep talking
Talking everyday
First you're telling stories
Then you're telling lies
When the fuck
Are you gonna realize
That I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Know that you're full of shit
I don't want to hear it
Oh shut up!
You see me and
You laugh out loud
You taunt me from safe
Inside your crowd
My looks, they
Must threaten you
To make you act
The way you do
Red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
You see me and
You think I'm a jerk
First impressions
Without a word
You can't believe
Your eyes at first
But now you know
You've seen the worst
Red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
Red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm seeing red
I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and fuck my head
Hang out with the living dead
Snort white shit up my nose
Pass out at the shows
I don't even think about speed
That's something I just don't need
I've got straight edge
I'm a person just like you
But I've got better things to do
Than sit around and smoke dope
'Cause I know I can cope
Laugh at the thought of eating ludes
Laugh at the thought of sniffing glue
Always gonna keep in touch
Never want to use a crutch
I've got straight edge
I've got straight edge
I've got straight edge
I've got straight edge
Compete, compete, do it for the boys
Empty barrels make the most noise
You're always on the move
You've always got something to prove
What the fuck are you fighting for?
Is it because you're five foot four?
You better be happy with what you've got
You'll never get any more
You laugh at a man when he tries
You're trying to make up for your size
To you life is a rivalry
Keep a step ahead of me
What the fuck are you fighting for?
Is it because you're five foot four?
You better be happy with what you've got
You'll never get any more
Small man, big mouth!
Small man, big mouth!
Small man, big mouth!
Small man, big mouth!
I'm gonna knock it down
Any way that I can
I'm gonna scream, I'm gonna yell
I don't want to have to use my hands
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
Someday it's gonna fall
You built that wall up around you
And now you can't see out
And you can't hear my words
No matter how loud I shout
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
It's like screaming at a wall
Someday it's gonna fall
You're safe inside and you know it
'Cause I can't get to you
And you know I resent it
And my temper grows
You better reinforce those walls
Until you don't have no room to stand
'Cause someday the bricks are gonna fall
Someday I'm gonna use my hands
Get your bravery from a six pack
Get your bravery from a half-pint
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up and you don't feel pain
Drink your whiskey, drink your grain
Bottoms up and you don't feel pain
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Bottled violence
Lose control of your body
Beat the shit out of somebody
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
But you don't take any shit
Half-shut eyes don't see who you hit
But you don't take any shit
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Bottled violence
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Go out and fight, fight
Bottled violence
We're not the first, I hope we're not the last
'Cause I know we're all heading for that adult crash
The time is so little, the time belongs to us
Why is everybody in such a fucking rush?
Make do with what you have
Take what you can get
Pay no mind to us
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
I was early to finish, I was late to start
I might be an adult, but I'm a minor at heart
Go to college, be a man, what's the fucking deal?
It's not how old I am, it's how old I feel
Take your time
Try not to forget
We never will
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
We're just a minor threat
Something's fucked up
Something's not right
I came to have a good time
You came to fight
But if I do fight nothing to fear
'Cause I know my friends are here
I don't like to fight
I don't like getting hurt
Got my guard up state of alert
Something's fucked up
Something's not right
I came to have a good time
You came to fight
But if I do fight nothing to fear
'Cause I know my friends are here
I don't look for trouble trouble finds me
Needs my friends in an emergency
Something's fucked up
Something's not right
I came to have a good time
You came to fight
But if I do fight nothing to fear
'Cause I know my friends are here
Don't go out alone go with a friend
You might need him in the end
Something's fucked up
Something's not right
I came to have a good time
You came to fight
But if I do fight nothing to fear
'Cause I know my friends are here
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up
Stand up and be counted

Got you in a corner
Oh no no no
Flex your head
1-2-X-U
Flex your head!
You tell me you like the taste
You just need an excuse
You tell me it calms your nerves
You just think it looks cool
You tell me you want to be different
You just change for the same
You tell me it's only natural
You just need the proof
Did you fucking get it?
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't
Look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't
Look that way to me
In my eyes
You tell me that nothing matters
You're just fucking scared
You tell me that I'm better
You just hate yourself
You tell me that you like her
You just wish you did
You tell me that I make no difference
At least I'm fuckin' trying
What the fuck have you done?
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
It's in my eyes, it's in my eyes
And it doesn't
Look that way to me
In my eyes
And it doesn't
Look that way to me
In my eyes
Don't smoke
Don't drink
Don't fuck
At least I can fucking think
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
Don't smoke
Don't drink
Don't fuck
At least I can fucking think
I can't keep up

Out of step with the world
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
I'm sorry for something I didn't do
Lynched somebody but I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
I'm sorry for something I didn't do
Lynched somebody but I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
I'm a convict
Guilty!
Of a racist crime
Guilty!
I've only served
Guilty!
19 years of my time
I'm sorry for something I didn't do
Lynched somebody but I don't know who
You blame me for slavery
A hundred years before I was born
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
Guilty of being white
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
You're trying to make your mark in society
Using all the tricks that you used on me
You're reading all those high fashion magazines
The clothes you're wearin' girl are causing public scenes
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
When I first met you girl you didn't have no shoes
Now you're walking 'round like you're front page news
You've been awful careful 'bout the friends you choose
But you won't find my name in your book of who's who
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
I'm not your stepping stone
Not your stepping stone
Maybe it was no one's fault
I know it wasn't mine
But now that you've moved along
I guess I'm next in line
I thought we had the same ideas
But you, you proved me wrong
I've been played the fool before
But never for quite so long
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
So what now? Do we shake hands
And go our separate ways?
Or do I open my mind
And follow you into the haze?
No, I'll see you tomorrow
Same channel, same time, same place
I'm not going anywhere
Cause I quit your fucking race
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
Betray, betray
Goddammit, we were supposed to stay young
And now it's over, it's finished, it's done
Normal expectations, they were on the run
But now it's over, it's finished, it's done
I thought I had left it behind
In another fucking time
When boys were boys, girls were girls
And faces were hard to find
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
All the stupid thinking
Stupid people thought
The rules that we lived by
The friends that we bought
The asshole with a strong arm
In the shape of floating friends
The young ladies and their secrets
In the soap that never ends
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
You know I thought I had outrun it
When I crossed the tracks
I thought I had gotten away
But it tapped me on the back
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
It followed me
Everybody's right
Everything I've done has all been wrong
You know I tried I tried to keep it short
I know it took too fucking long
Too much has been said
You think it fucked my head?
Think again, think again
Think again
Ignorance, it set your standards
Intelligence, that don't work in your brain
You're an adult, so you act like a child
Don't even try to explain
This stupid shit, it's been done
You think you're the only one?
Think again, think again
Think again
A hand to your mouth
A performing yawn
I guess you know
What the fuck is going on
You're on top, you're on the ball
You think you've seen it all?
Think again, think again
Think again
Before you take another crack
And slap yourself on the back
Before you tell me what you heard
And sum it up in one word
Before you start talking shit
Before you throw another fit
Think again, think again
Think again
I want to tell you a little story
Cause it makes me warm inside
It's about some friends growing up
And all the things they tried
I'm not talking about staple shit
They went for something more
I guess it was too much dreaming
Too much to hope for
One day something funny happened
But it scared the shit out of me
Their heads went in different directions
And their friendship ceased to be
One day something funny happened
But it scared the shit out of me
Their heads went in different directions
And their friendship ceased to be
Someday we'll look back and laugh
I'm telling you I want it to work
I don't like being hurt
Something's not right inside
And I can't always put it aside
What can we do, what can we do?
Try
Try
Try
Try
I guess I make too much shit
Someday we'll look back and laugh
I'm telling you I want it to work
I don't like being hurt
Something's not right inside
And I can't always put it aside
What can we do, what can we do?
Try
Try
Try
Try
I guess I make too much shit
Someday we'll look back and laugh
Mr. Present, go away
Come back and fuck with us some other day
Mr. Feelings, run and hide
You have no right to what you feel inside
Motherfuckers, quick to kiss
Talk you shit, but don't fuck with this
And all I want to know, all I want to know
Am I holding on? Am I moving on?
What can we do, what can we do?
What can we do, what can we do?
What can we do, what can we do?
What can we do, what can we do?
Try
Try
Try
Try
Life's not been good for you
It's just not fair
You did nothing to deserve it
You did nothing at all
Sit back and watch
It turns from bad to worse
No matter how loud you cry
It always hurts
Boy I'm glad I'm not in your shoes
How could things
Get any worse for you?
You're so fucking alone
How could things
Get any worse for you?
I don't blame you
When you piss and moan
Everybody gets
What you should've got
Everybody takes
Your opportunities
Everybody gets
The breaks that belonged to you
Everybody takes
Your just desserts
Boy I'm glad I'm not in your shoes
How could things
Get any worse for you?
You're so fucking alone
How could things
Get any worse for you?
I don't blame you
When you piss and moan
Life's not been good for you
It's just not fair
I've got some news for you
Nothing is fair
I wish there was a way
To make it all better
I pray for a way
To make you happy
Cause I'm sick and I'm tired
Of your whining, complaining, and bitching and moaning
Boo fucking hoo
So you hate me
That's the way it goes
What the fuck?
I guess I'll never know
If it makes you feel better
Then I guess it's just as good
You know I'll never accept it
Cause I never thought you could
Sit in the same room
We look the other way
Fuck conversation
We've got nothing to say
I'm sure we both
Hate to be ignored
Haven't we
Met someplace before?
What's the problem?
Is it justified?
Or are we dealing
With our fucking prides?
Do you really
Want to leave it alone?
I don't know what it's worth to you
It's all I fucking own
Sit in the same room
We look the other way
Fuck conversation
We've got nothing to say
I'm sure we both
Hate to be ignored
Haven't we
Met someplace before?
Haven't we met before?
Haven't we met before?
Haven't we met before?
Haven't we met before?
There are no words
For what I want to say
No description
For what I feel
It's a non-emotion
It's something gray
Way down
Inside of me
You could call it anger
You could call it fear
You could call it frustration
That's as close as you get
Now I'm waiting
For security
There's something racing
Inside of me
I'm waiting, I'm waiting
For a sign
I'm waiting for something
Got nothing but time
You could call it anger
You could call it fear
You could call it frustration
That's as close as you get
You could call it anger
You could call it fear
You could call it frustration
And you'd still be wrong
And why not?
And now I'm waiting
For security
There's something racing
Inside of me
I said I'm waiting
Waiting for a sign
Just me and my little friend
He's deep inside
I said I'm waiting
Waiting for a sign
Waiting for something
Got nothing but time
Nothing but time
Nothing but time
Nothing but time
Don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
Don't smoke
I don't drink
I don't fuck
At least I can fucking think
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
Listen, there's not set of rules
I'm not telling what to do
All I'm saying is, I'm bringing up
Three things, that are like, so important to the whole world
I don't dignify much importance in
Because of these things
Whether, whether their fucking or playing golf
Because of that, I feel
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
I can't keep up
Out of step with the world
How do you do? I don't think that we've met
My name is Ian and I'm from Minor Threat
You know I tell them, usually, to be at their best
Catch me in town after every set
Yea, yea
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your show
I got some money and I'm feeling fine
A couple of dollars, it means a good time
Well, you know I'm gonna be alright
With the money I'm making off of you tonight
Sucker
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your show
Know something? The problem with money is I want more
Let's raise the price at the door. How much tonight, three thousand or four
Then we'll make a million when we go on tour
Yeah, that's the way I'm gonna think about it
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your show
And that's the way it is, man... Dog eat dog
I'm taking a walk on the yellow brick road
I only walk where the bricks are made of gold
My mind and body are the only things that I've sold
I need a little money cause I'm getting old
Right? That's the way it goes isn't it? Yea
We don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your show
Yeah, we don't care
We don't pose
We'll steal your money
We'll steal your show
That's the way it is in this world
Right? Isn't that right?
Boy... you had us pegged all along... damn
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So, where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So, where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So, where am I?
There's no place like home
Right?
There's no place like home
So, where am I?
There's no place like home
There's no place like home
So, where am I?
Wishing for the days
When I first wore this suit
Baby has grown older
It's no longer cute
Too many voices
They've made me mute
Baby has grown ugly
It's no longer cute
But I stay on, I stay on
Where do I get off?
On to greener pastures
The core has gotten soft
Look at us today
We've gotten soft and fat
Waiting for the moment
It's just no coming back
So serious
About the stuff we lack
Dwell upon our memories
But there are no facts
No way to go
Which way to go
Where did we go
Why did we go
Why did we go
Where did we go
How did we go
Why did we go
No way to go
The time has come for everyone to party
The time has come for everyone to get down
The time has come come come
The time has come come come come come
I'm a poor boy born in a rut
Some say my manners ain't the best
Some of my friends have been in a whole lot of trouble
And some say I'm no better than the rest
But tell your momma and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white
Everyday I work hard
At night I spend restless time
Those rich kids and all their lazy money
They can't hold a candle to mine
So tell your momma and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white
Good guys, bad guys
Which is which?
The white collar worker
Or the digger of the ditch?
Man, who's to say who's the better man?
I'm doing the very best I can
Best I can
You thought I had a dirty mind
All those messed up chicks
Of the changing times
Love-filled and easy living
Can't come close
To the love that I've given
So tell your momma and your papa
Sometimes good guys don't wear white
They don't wear white
They don't wear white
They don't wear white
They don't wear white
Serious as a heart attack
Makes me feel this way
No device to measure
No words can define
I mean what I'm trying to say
Is how can I express
Let alone possess?
Serious as a heart attack
Makes me feel this way
As the revolution cries "The time is near!"
I could feel my bones, I could see with my eyes
Can't avoid it, can't agree
As the revolution cries "The time is near!"
Senses loose in knots... my logic is my style
Can't avoid it, must make a stand
Let's say I got a number -- that number's fifty thousand
That's ten percent of five hundred thousand
Oh, here we are in French Indochina!
Executive order, congressional decision
The working masses are manipulated
Was this our policy? Ten long years...
Not one domino shall fall
I don't want to hurt
See, my position was here
I mean, as it was, I was...
So, this led to the downfall of man
I can make seconds feel hours
I make certain that my head is connected to my body
No hope? See, that's what gives me guts
Big fucking shit! Right now, man
On the back of a winged horse
Through the sky of pearly grey
Love is leaf-like...
You and me, baby
Twinkle, twinkle
Blah, blah, blah
E! T! C!
Caught by a camera taken at shutter speed
My neck's in a knot, two beads at the end
Bolt cutters close, my head rolls again
Trapped in your snare, voices fly at me
Snap like a tiger, strikes like a snake
Feel like a poker in someone's fireplace
A word war will set off the keg
My words are war
Should a word have two meanings?
What the fuck for?
Should words serve the truth?
I stand for language
I speak for truth
I shout for history
I am a cesspool
For all the shit
To run down in
Who'll take the salt from the mines?
Who'll take the dirt from the earth?
Who'll take the leaf and grow it to a tree?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Who'll work the fields with his hands?
Who'll put his back to the plow?
Who'll take the mountain and give it to the sea?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Don't look now, someone's done your starving
Don't look now, someone's done your praying
Who'll make the shoes for your feet?
Who'll make the clothes that you wear?
Who'll take the promise that you don't gotta keep?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Who'll take the promise that you don't gotta keep?
Don't look now, it ain't you or me
Let the products sell themselves
Fuck advertising, commercial psychology
Psychological methods to sell should be destroyed
Because of their own blind involvement
In their own conditioned minds
The unit bonded together
Morals, ideals, awareness, progress
Let yourself be heard
The boundary, the border of right and wrong
The tariff is self, the freedom of feeling the criminal
The pied piper, the heart and mind...
The pied piper, the heart and mind...
Nature without man, nature without man...
Nature without man, nature without man...
What can be romantic to Mike Watt?
He's only a skeleton
His body is a series of points
No height, length or width
In his joints, he feels life
His strongest connection
Between the yelling and the sleep
Pain is the toughest riddle
He's chalk
He's a dartboard
His sex is disease
He's a stop sign
He's chalk
He's a dartboard
His sex is disease
He's a stop sign
List monitors arrive with petition
Iron-fisted philosophy...
Is your life worth a painting?
Is this 'girl vs. boy' with different symbols?
Being born is power
Scout leader nazi tagged as 'big sin'
Your risk chains me hostage
Me, I'm fighting with my head, I'm not ambiguous
I must look like a dork
Me, naked with textbook poems
Spout fountain against the Nazis
With weird kinds of sex symbols
In speeches that are big dance thumps
If we heard mortar shells
We'd cuss more in our songs
And cut down on guitar solos
So dig this big crux
Organizing the boy scouts for murder is wrong
Ten years beyond the big sweat point
Man, it was still there ever without you
Coming back around, look!
Coming together, for just a second
A peek, a guess
At the wholeness it's way too big
At the wholeness it's way too big
As I look over this beautiful land, I can't help but realize
That I am alone
Why am I able to waste my energy
To notice life being so beautiful?
Maybe partying will help
What of the people who don't have what I ain't got?
Are they victims of my leisure?
To fail is to be a victim
To be a victim of my choice
Maybe partying will help
No. 7 on the chump list
Playin' stooge, eatin' shit
Toadies, toadies
Using that as a reason
For kickin' shit on the dumb fucks
Toadies, toadies
We are cuss-words, nearly illiterate
Dedicated to fightin' toadies
Toadies, toadies, toadies
Real things conditioning will lose their meaning
The toilet starts flushing; sets me off again
But I am a thorn, I read it in your face
The cough's a thunderclap, my head's a tape recorder
A richer understanding of what's already understood
No meanings from the here and now
What gift could be a work of art?
Can you call it the big foist?
I'm fuckin' overwhelmed!
In a tomb of Enoch, in the queen's chambers
She lives, guarding that holy cubit
God-given accuracy, measuring untold prophecy
How she loved that sacred inch...
The people will survive
In their environment
The dirt, scarcity, and the emptiness
Of our South
The injustice of our greed
The practice we inherit
The dirt, scarcity and the emptiness
Of our South
There on the beach
I could see it in her eyes
I only had a Corona
Five cent deposit
Starting with the affirmation of man
I work myself backwards using cynicism
The time monitor, the space measurer
I live sweat but I dream light years
I am the tide, the rise and the fall
The reality soldier, the laugh child
The one of the many, the flame child
The time monitor, the space measurer
Hope we can rely on you not to use shower...
You're not keeping the tub caulked
Caused both downstairs bath ceilings and walls to be soggy
Tub has to be properly caulked prior to you showering
Walls are drenched -- both roofer and plumber here
Had to pay for two service calls
Water drips from all around
Kathy's ceiling, my ceiling
Don't use shower... don't use shower...
And so my soul collapsed into a big guilt wad
Some big thunder law forces me to eat shit
And if I was a word could my letters number a hundred?
More likely coarse and guttural one syllable anglo saxon
I'm a victim of fact let's say I loved a girl
But the world was wrong and I was forced to march in line
But it felt like handcuffs
Machines disregard my pronouns
I am defeated
I am a cool damp clay
Our band could be your life
Real names'd be proof
Me and Mike Watt, we played for years
Punk rock changed our lives
We learned punk rock in Hollywood
Drove up from Pedro
We were fucking corndogs
We'd go drink and pogo
Mr. Narrator
This is Bob Dylan to me
My story could be his songs
I'm his soldier child
Our band is scientist rock
But I was E. Bloom, Richard Hell
Joe Strummer and John Doe
Me and Mike Watt, playing guitar
Soft and understanding eyes of the young
Moving with abandon atop the green lawns
Malleable as luck allows faking all the ties
Forced out in time
These expressions met
Improvised inventions
Lost in the way
Absolute the course
Which instinct betrays
Grinding in reversal
Outdo til done
Proper naked self
Solutions surround
In brightness be it real
Blinded and free
Pastel gems hit
Pearlesque in flaw
Spark of the instant
Challenging the time
View the observer's
Plagiarizing hands
Force fed
Sifted
Tin can
Pull handle
Puppet
Pull toys
Has it been 40 years?
Still a hostage
New kind of fascist
There in West Germany
The people are battlefields
East and west
The lines are drawn
How are you to live?
Fear of death is so close
Crimes on our heads
Are we ignorant, blind?
Afraid to swallow our pride
Man's law
Man creates Hitler
From the grassroots
To the UN
A year a minute
Man setting watches
On off Hitlers
Time dictates order
We must be schizo
To buy the bullshit!
We're time Nazis
We strip out tunes
We jam econo
It makes a stench
All these men who work the land
Should evaluate themselves and make a stand
Can't they see beyond the rhetoric?
The lies and promises that don't mean shit
And all the men who learned to hate them
And all the men who learned to hate them
They keep themselves hidden away
They keep themselves upon the hill
Afraid that they'll have to pay
For all the crimes upon their head
And all the men who learned to hate them
And all the men who learned to hate them
Just wake up
And tug my hair
And let me know
All of the outside world and you are there
And never be too gentle with me
The interruption went
Small snag in life
Pothole in the road
It's only a detour
A minor deterrent
That can't unload
My examination
Parts a to b
There is no cause
No cause at all
For my hesitation
Nothing indeed
Everything that's been
The future smashed
Carbon-copy dream
Pipe down the drain
The anxious cast's fighting for next play
Too late, too late
For what mistake
No cash and no exchange
Too late, too late
How can I
Make an outline of myself
Wheres the guidelines?
For the profiles
For my country
How do others see me?
I'm worried
Worried but I feel guilty
The media
Robs and betrays us
No more lies
We are responsible
Working on the edge
Losing my self-respect
For a man who presides over me
The principles of his creed
Punch in, punch out
Eight hours, five days
Sweat, pain and agony
On Friday I'll get paid
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
Hey mister don't look down on me
For what I believe
I got my bills and the rent
I should pitch a tent
But our land isn't free
So I'll work my youth away
In the place of a machine
I refuse to be a slave
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
This ain't no picnic
A clear and dusty day in June
My stoned mind just spilled that line
Describing, what's it like, describing?
Believing that the sum is "yes"
Looking around at all my comrades
My police state mind just spilled that line
I want to give names to our bonds
I need names to play the game
But what makes my heart run?
Why the thunder in my thighs?
My body
My mind
The idea of my life
Seems like a symbol
The western hemisphere and all inside
We know who's murdering the innocent
They are children playing with guns
They are children playing with countries
Mining harbors, creating contras
The games they play, the lives they take
They bank their money in this country
They steal from the innocent
A colonial trait that's much too old
The banks, the lives, the profits, the lies
The banks, the profits, the lives and the lies
I would call it genocide
Any other word would be a lie
I had a girl
She loved what she saw
She loved me so good
She made her daddy mad
My woman cried
She's dead to me now
My woman ran off
And I can't deny it
My life - Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
I had a job
It paid me good
I could have my fun
And tip the preacher too
My boss yelled
He's dead to me now
My boss kicked me out
And I can't deny it
My life - Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
You better listen to me
'Cause I'm gonna tell you, son
Don't give away your love
And don't give away your sweat
Because a girl can't know you
And a boss can't afford you
Remember
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
Remember
Jesus and tequila
I'm satisfied
And I can't deny it
If I could, I surely would
Give my life to you
So you can have two
Take me in your arms and lie to me
You tell me it's always going
To be like this
The world is the coldest place
Surely the coldest place
There's a storm inside my house
Raging and relentless
Wind tearing at the rafters
Howling through the timbers
Hard stinging rain
Falling in and falling down
Hope this storm doesn't rip my roof off
My skin keeps the storm inside
What you makin', man
Takes time
A little bit
A little bit more
The effort's worth it
Feels good
Designed
By me
Try and try
That's the way you want it
If you know
That ain't the way it always goes
A little bit
A little bit more
What you makin', man
Takes time
Well I been to the edge
And there I stood and looked down
You know I lost a lot of friends there
I got no time to fuck around
Fuck you!
Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
Hey hey hey!
It don't seem right
Well I been strung out here all night
I'm waiting for the taste you said you'd bring to me
Biscayne Bay
Where the Cuban children
Sleep all day
I'm searching for the song
You used to sing to me
Katy lies
You can see it in her eyes
Imagine my surprise
When I saw you
Are you with me Dr. Wu
Or are you really just a shadow of the man that I once knew?
Are you crazy?
Are you high?
Are you just an ordinary guy?
Have you done all you can do?
Are you with me, doctor?
Can you hear me, doctor?
Are you with me, doctor?
Can you hear me, doctor?
Highest love, a woman's touch
A strong mind, a strong body
All the things he couldn't have
All the things he couldn't see
Little man with a gun in his hand
The state
The church
The plans
The waste
The dead
The mine
The cut
What's the verb behind it all?
The do
The how
Thy why
The where
The when
The what
Can these words refine that truth?
It's not just a blink
Or the following of an arm
And it isn't just a flicker
No, it isn't just a flicker
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
That you can't explain
Oh, there's a look in your eyes
And when it slips through the rain
Oh, there's a criss-crossed thinking
(No, it's not just a blink)
There's a deeper tear
(No, it's not just a blink)
From the house you live in
(No, it's not just a blink)
There's a place we can't ignore
(No, it isn't just a flicker)
There's a look in your eyes
And it's two-thirds real
It's the pulling of the undertow
When you can't control the wheel
It's not just a blink
Or the following of an arm
No, it isn't just a flicker
No, it isn't just a flicker
There's a look in your eyes
That you can't explain
There's a look in your eyes
And it slips through the rain
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the guise
Underneath the guise
Underneath the gaze
Underneath the guise
Underneath it goes away
Yeah, I'm ready
Making sense of all the hidden facts
Hit and run, that's the way it's made
Sick and tired of all Neanderthals?
Getting nowhere
Getting nowhere
Pretend to give a fuck
How can you pretend to give a fuck?
When nothing seems to matter at all
Across construction street
While the mental left to fornicate
We fly on this empty shell
We fly on this empty shell
Find another way
Show me, show me
Find another way
Show me, show me
Far away
So far away
When I think it's there
It's there in the (so far away)
When I think it's there
It's there in the
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me away, show me my partner
Blood, carry me
The face at the window
The features I know
I try to escape but
The world is too slow
The question is big
The question is wide
I can't see around it
I see only one side
I hid from the heavens
The heaviest sleep
Deserve the unwanted
When love is so deep
Now I was touching you
The pleasures are past
And now there is only
The houses we pass
The dreams are all melting
Only to reform
Outside the heavens
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Where thoughts are reborn
Do a couple notes at the end
Singing after the first (maybe)
There was once a special book
It got changed by fascist crooks
(Save me please for I am weak)
There once was a great idea
Now they water it down to fizz
(Save me please for I am weak)
(Save me please for I'm a sheep)
Well, I suppose it's human nature
But when he said
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me, oh no
The Roman Empire never died
(Save me I am not a goat)
Just changed into the Catholic Church
(Dionysus has cloven hooves)
The Roman Empire never died
(Devil horns are not on me)
Save me I am not a goat
Ha ha ha ha
But when he said
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Don't make an idol of me
Plastic idols of me
Plaster idols of me, oh
Don't make an idol of me
He said
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
(Walk the shores of Galilee)
Where only the Spirit can talk to me
He said
Well I walk the shores of Galilee
On the desert sands and no one can touch me
(Don't touch me, no don't)
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
What's this?
All these crimes
Committed in my name
Oh, well
Had the choice but lost my chance
Heard a voice and changed my stance
All I needed was a clue
Had enough of golden rules
Now the days are open wounds
All I needed was a clue
Find a way to turn things back
What never happened seems to last
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?
Where did things go wrong?
Oh, every raw material at hand
Oh, remember all the things you said you'd do?
What happens next?
What happens now?
What happens next?
And the need for a book as far as I see
Conditioned by steps
One, two, three, four
Often seems that opportunity knocks
When the door is bolted, the door is locked
Door is bolted and the door is locked
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
Don't take me by the hand
The tools of the trade are the head and the heart
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
And the joke I know
What I will be when I grow up
If I grow up
When I grow up
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
Throw away the brainwash
And I give up
Don't give up
And I give up
Don't give up
(And I give up)
Don't give up
Don't give in
Learn how!
Every raw material at hand
Every raw material at hand
And then they're gone
Every raw material in your hand
(Anything was just total...)
First she says
Why mince modes?
If you feel like a patient why not dress like one?
Then she says
Why can't I sleep?
Between icy wet white sheets for three days
And sink down deeper than dreams
Oh, I'd love that
I'd be a mineral deposit
A ball of mica inside a rock
I'd be a mineral deposit
A ball of mica inside a rock
Hey
Then there'd be no whistles, no radios
No screams
Then there'd be no whistles, no radios
No screams
First she says
Why mince modes?
If you feel like a patient why not dress like one?
Then she says
Why can't I sleep?
Between icy wet white sheets for three days
And sink down deeper than dreams
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
What could I say to that? (What could I say to that?)
Every man thinks he does what he can
Then he and he's holding the weatherbox
Every night
Then he and he's holding the weatherbox
Holding the weatherbox
Holding the weatherbox
Sun is falling down
Sky is falling down
Seasons falling down
Air is falling down
The air is round and the world is flat
And everything is clearly impossible
Clearly impossible
Inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
Bombs roll inside the weatherbox
I said my mother's dead
Well, I don't care about it
I said my father's dead
But I don't care about it
It happens anyway
It happens anyway
On the edge of Burma
We're on the edge of Burma, oh
I said my baby twists
She twists the night away
I swear she twists so good
And then she turned to me
And then she turned to me
And then I heard her say
"Well, that's the way I like it
Well, that's the way I like it
I like it too much"
Chairs next to the windows
Carpets touch the walls
Time slides through the windows
And slips behind the walls
In the dark of night
Or in the light of day
Underneath the painting
Where it once was clear
Well I was rolled in water
I was rolled out past the pier
In the tray of colors
The whirlwind appears
When you are young
They kick you in the head
And when you grow up
They're still fucking with your head
So when I found out
What it was I didn't want
I start to run
And I start to hunt
'Cause at the bottom of the well
The seed is a pit
And it makes me wanna make the world
Nervous as shit
Because I'm made of gold, brass
And I wanna break it like glass, glass, glass
So when I was young
It didn't make any sense
And when I grew up
It made just as little sense
So when I found out
What it was I didn't want
I got new armor
And I started to hunt
'Cause at the bottom of the well
The seed is a pit
And it makes me wanna make the world
Nervous as shit
Because I'm made of gold, brass
And I wanna break it like glass, glass, glass
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
Fun world
(That's how I escaped my certain fate)
This might be your only chance
To prove it on your own
Tulsa's not that
Tulsa's not that far
Besides if you stay
I'd feel a certain guilt
Did I hold you
Did I hold you back?
Can I count on you
If I fall apart?
Yeah, if I fall a
If I fall apart
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Innocence a novice's mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fate
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Honesty's an actor's worst mistake
That's how I escaped my certain fate
Laugh the world away
There's a bathroom
There's a voicebox
And a light bulb over my head
Laugh the world away
Everything is just as expected
No one thinks but they all talk
Laugh the world away
Well it seems like
I will never ever ever never ever never ever never ever ever take the chance again
Take the chance again
The chance
The
I can see the faces
Shining down with very
And when I see them I can recall this
When I'm waking I feel
That's justice
That is justice
White walls
Tattooed papers
Confused by the details
Dangerous
They are just monuments
Demanding to get a reaction
When you are close to me
It is all right
When you are close to me
I can forget
People talk
And then disappear
I swerve
Just to listen to words
I stand upon this stupid platform
That I made with my own hands
When you when you when you're close to me
It is all right
When you are close to me
I can forget
Oh when you, when
Down with history
Down with sense
Nothing makes much difference
I'll surrender to this tragic mess
Spinning ball of randomness
Where logos is the finest blasphemy
Men's lives pass like strips of film
Recorded gestures, acts of will
I'd like to think that down through time
They'd compose a logical line
But chances are that's just a pile of shit
And I can't help but bow my head and cry
It took so long to finally realize
That all our hopes are based on such gross lies
Classroom lessons World War II
Atrocities against the Jews
Never again our solemn vow
That's why we all share Cambodia
Isn't it great how far we've come since then?
And I can't help but bow my head and cry
It took so long to finally realize
That all our hopes are based on such gross lies
Dialectic shit
Evolution's crap
Time and time again the masquerade is
Shown for what it really is
Progress, progress a pleasant myth
Progress a pleasant myth
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
Progress, progress
Pleasant myth
That makes my life worthwhile
That makes my life
Oh
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
So you think you've got it figured out
Ok
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
And at night you've got no doubt
No way
Got a feeling inside of me
Ok
it might not be
Ok
that don't move an inch
Ok
got no sense
No way
Don't tell me that god is dead
Don't tell me that Marx is dead
When it's times like this my friend
I don't feel too well myself, no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
So you think you've got it figured out
Ok
So you think you've got it all worked out
Ok
And at night you've got no doubt
No way
Don't tell me that god is dead
Don't tell me that Marx is dead
When it's times like this my friend
I don't feel too well myself, no
Oh no
Oh no
Oh no
Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to
I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that it said
And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees
Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
Three miles to go
Three miles to go
At the end of the road
There's a soldier waiting for me
I've got three miles to go
Three miles to go
At the end of the road
There's a soldier waiting for me
At the end of the road
At the end of the road
At the end of the road
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy
Forever to be still
Breath held tight inside of me
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy
Forever to be still
Breath held tight inside of me
Life goes on and on...
It's a red sky tonight
It's a red sky tonight
At the end of the road
Where all futures go
At the end of the road
There's a soldier waiting for me
He's got three miles to go
Three miles to go
At the end of the road
At the end of the road
There's blood on shore
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy
Forever to be still
Breath held tight inside of me
Life goes on and on in this real life fantasy
Forever to be still
Breath held tight inside of me
When a new life turns towards you
And the night becomes a bay
We shall remain forever
Everyone who meets his way
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
When the rain falls to the sea
They'll be waiting for you and for me
And the sky reflects our image
Trying to sleep right through our lives
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun and the trees and the birth
Oh, our love is like the earth
The sun and the trees and the birth
I am still here two days later
Same place, same time
And I'm stuck here two years too long
Same place, the wrong time
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The rain and the sea and the hours
Oh, our love is like the flowers
The sun and the sea and the hours
Their love died three years ago
Spoken words I cannot show
I see danger
On the corner sent by me
Shadows the ways
Straight away you ran from me
I heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
I heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
I hear silence
I hear silence in my heart (house)
From a distance
Turn your back and run (hide) from me
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
When it happens
You will be no friend of mine
Take the first chance
When I am no longer free
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
In the future
When you want me in your heart
I won't be there (help you)
If you call out in the dark
Heard you calling
Yes, I heard you calling
Heard you calling
Oh yes I heard you, heard you, heard you, heard you calling
Can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings I can't hide
Can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings I can't hide
Oh, can you hear me deep inside
From these feelings i can't hide
Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me calling you
Can you hear me calling you
Can you head me calling you
How does it feel
To treat me like you do
When you've laid your hands upon me
And told me who you are
I thought I was mistaken
I thought I heard your words
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how do I feel
Those who came before me
Lived through their vocations
From the past until completion
They will turn away no more
And I still find it so hard
To say what I need to say
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me
Just how I should feel today
I see a ship in the harbor
I can and shall obey
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes
I'd be a heavenly person today
And I thought I was mistaken
And I thought I heard you speak
Tell me how do I feel
Tell me now how should I feel
Now I stand here waiting
I thought I told you to leave me
While I walked down to the beach
Tell me how does it feel
When your heart grows cold
(Grows cold, grows cold, grows cold)
A thought that never changes
Remains a stupid lie
It's never been quite the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement, no colors
Just silence
Rise and fall of shame
A search that shall remain
We asked you what you'd seen
You said you didn't care
Sound formed in a vacuum
May seem a waste of time
It's always been just the same
No hearing or breathing
No movement no lyrics
Just nothing
The sign that leads the way
The path we can not take
You've caught me at a bad time
So why don't you piss off
Who saw those dark eyes
Who saw those dark eyes
These years gone by
Deep within
Burn my skin
All those years gone by
In the heat of the night
All those years gone by
Who felt those cold hands
Who felt those cold hands
Touch my skin
Deep within
Burn my soul
Fell to the ground
Where I was found
All those years ago
All those tears ago
All those years ago
Everybody makes mistakes
Everybody makes mistakes
Even me
Just be free
This is a place
Where in the end
It happens in
Our world within
Time to go
Time to go
On a thousand islands in the sea
I see a thousand people just like me
A hundred unions in the snow
I watch them walking, falling in a row
We live always underground
It's going to be so quiet in here tonight
A thousand islands in the sea
It's a shame
And a hundred years ago
A sailor trod this ground I stood upon
Take me away everyone
When it hurts thou
From my head to my toes
From the words in the book
I see a vision that would bring me luck
From my head to my toes
To my teeth, through my nose
You get these words wrong
You get these words wrong
Everytime
You get these words wrong
I just smile
But from my head to my toes
From my knees to my eyes
Everytime I watch the sky
For these last few days leave me alone
But for these last few days leave me alone
Leave me alone
Leave me alone
Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine
Meltin' in a pot of thieves
Wild card up my sleeve
Thick heart of stone
My sins my own
They belong to me, me
People say "beware!"
But I don't care
The words are just
Rules and regulations to me, me
I-I walk in a room, you know I look so proud
I'm movin' in this here atmosphere, well, anything's allowed
And I go to this here party and I just get bored
Until I look out the window, see a sweet young thing
Humpin' on the parking meter, leanin' on the parking meter
Oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling and then I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
Ooh I'll put my spell on her
Here she comes
Walkin' down the street
Here she comes
Comin' through my door
Here she comes
Crawlin' up my stair
Here she comes
Waltzin' through the hall
In a pretty red dress
And oh, she looks so good, oh, she looks so fine
And I got this crazy feeling that I'm gonna ah-ah make her mine
And then I hear this knockin' on my door
Hear this knockin' on my door
And I look up into the big tower clock
And say, "oh my God here's midnight!"
And my baby is walkin' through the door
Leanin' on my couch she whispers to me and I take the big plunge
And oh, she was so good and oh, she was so fine
And I'm gonna tell the world that I just ah-ah made her mine
And I said darling, tell me your name, she told me her name
She whispered to me, she told me her name
And her name is, and her name is, and her name is, and her name is G-L-O-R-I-A
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
I was at the stadium
There were twenty thousand girls called their names out to me
Marie and Ruth but to tell you the truth
I didn't hear them I didn't see
I let my eyes rise to the big tower clock
And I heard those bells chimin' in my heart
Going ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong.
Ding dong ding dong ding dong ding dong
Counting the time, then you came to my room
And you whispered to me and we took the big plunge
And oh. you were so good, oh, you were so fine
And I gotta tell the world that I make her mine make her mine
Make her mine make her mine make her mine make her mine
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
And the tower bells chime, "ding dong" they chime
They're singing, "Jesus died for somebody's sins but not mine."
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A,
Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A, G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria,
G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria G-L-O-R-I-A Gloria.
Late afternoon, dreaming hotel
We just had the quarrel that sent you away.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Called you on the phone, another dimension.
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean.
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with a shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up
On Redondo Beach and everyone is so sad.
I was looking for you, are you gone gone?
Pretty little girl, everyone cried.
She was the victim of sweet suicide.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal,
Women all standing with shock on their faces.
Sad description, oh I was looking for you.
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up,
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now.
I went looking for you, are you gone gone?
Picked up my key, didn't reply.
Went to my room, started to cry.
You were small, an angel, are you gone gone?
Down by the ocean it was so dismal.
I was just standing with shock on my face.
The hearse pulled away, and the girl that had died, it was you.
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone gone.
Gone gone, gone gone, good-bye.
His father died and left him a little farm in New England.
All the long black funeral cars left the scene
And the boy was just standing there alone
Looking at the shiny red tractor
Him and his daddy used to sit inside
And circle the blue fields and grease the night.
It was if someone had spread butter on all the fine points of the stars
'Cause when he looked up they started to slip.
Then he put his head in the crux of his arm
And he started to drift, drift to the belly of a ship,
Let the ship slide open, and he went inside of it
And saw his daddy 'hind the control board streamin' beads of light,
He saw his daddy 'hind the control board,
And he was very different tonight
'Cause he was not human, he was not human.
And then the little boy's face lit up with such naked joy
That the sun burned around his lids and his eyes were like two suns,
White lids, white opals, seeing everything just a little bit too clearly
And he looked around and there was no black ship in sight,
No black funeral cars, nothing except for him the raven
And fell on his knees and looked up and cried out,
"No, daddy, don't leave me here alone,
Take me up, daddy, to the belly of your ship,
Let the ship slide open and I'll go inside of it
Where you're not human, you are not human."
But nobody heard the boy's cry of alarm.
Nobody there 'cept for the birds around the New England farm
And they gathered in all directions, like roses they scattered
And they were like compass grass coming together into the head of a shaman bouquet
Slit in his nose and all the others went shooting
And he saw the lights of traffic beckoning like the hands of Blake
Grabbing at his cheeks, taking out his neck,
All his limbs, everything was twisted and he said,
"I won't give up, won't give up, don't let me give up,
I won't give up, come here, let me go up fast,
Take me up quick, take me up, up to the belly of a ship
And the ship slides open and I go inside of it where I am not human."
I am helium raven and this movie is mine,
So he cried out as he stretched the sky,
Pushing it all out like latex cartoon, am I all alone in this generation?
We'll just be dreaming of animation night and day
And won't let up, won't let up and I see them coming in,
Oh, I couldn't hear them before, but I hear 'em now,
It's a radar scope in all silver and all platinum lights
Moving in like black ships, they were moving in, streams of them,
And he put up his hands and he said, "It's me, it's me,
I'll give you my eyes, take me up, oh now please take me up,
I'm helium raven waitin' for you, please take me up,
Don't let me here," the son, the sign, the cross,
Like the shape of a tortured woman, the true shape of a tortured woman,
The mother standing in the doorway letting her sons
No longer presidents but prophets
They're all dreaming they're gonna bear the prophet,
He's gonna run through the fields dreaming in animation
It's all gonna split his skull
It's gonna come out like a black bouquet shining
Like a fist that's gonna shoot them up
Like light, like Mohammed Boxer
Take them up up up up up up
Oh, let's go up, up, take me up, I'll go up,
I'm going up, I'm going up
Take me up, I'm going up, I'll go up there
Go up go up go up go up up up up up up up
Up, up to the belly of a ship.
Let the ship slide open and we'll go inside of it
Where we are not human, we're not human.
Well, there was sand, there were tiles,
The sun had melted the sand and it coagulated
Like a river of glass
When it hardened he looked at the surface
He saw his face
And where there were eyes were just two white opals, two white opals,
Where there were eyes there were just two white opals
And he looked up and the rays shot
And he saw raven comin' in
And he crawled on his back and he went up
Up up up up up up
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way, sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
Sha da do wop, da shaman do way,
We like birdland.
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery,
Scoop the pearls up from the sea
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need.
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad.
I take that money, buy you things you never had.
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free.
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby,
Get you on a higher plane to a jet stream
And take you through the stratosphere
And check out the planets there and then take you down
Deep where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream.
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money, free money.
Every night before I go to sleep
Find a ticket, win a lottery.
Every night before I rest my head
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed.
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me,
Baby, I know our troubles will be gone.
Oh, I know our troubles will be gone, goin' gone
If we dream, dream, dream for free.
And when we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it,
Let's dream it, we'll dream it for free, free money,
Free money, free money, free money,
Free money, free money, free money, free.
The wall is high, the black barn,
The babe in my arms in her swaddling clothes
And I know soon that the sky will split
And the planets will shift,
Balls of jade will drop and existence will stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.
Ah, here I stand again in this old 'lectric whirlwind,
The sea rushes up my knees like flame
And I feel like just some misplaced Joan Of Arc
And the cause is you lookin' up at me.
Oh baby, I remember when you were born,
It was dawn and the storm settled in my belly
And I rolled in the grass and I spit out the gas
And I lit a match and the void went flash
And the sky split and the planets hit,
Balls of jade dropped and existence stopped, stopped, stop, stop.
Little sister, the sky is falling, I don't mind, I don't mind.
Little sister, the fates are calling on you.
I was goin' crazy, so crazy I knew I could break through with you,
So with one hand I rocked you and with one heart I reached for you.
Ah, I knew your youth was for the takin', fire on a mental plane,
So I ran through the fields as the bats with their baby vein faces
Burst from the barn and flames in a violent violet sky,
And I fell on my knees and pressed you against me.
Your soul was like a network of spittle,
Like glass balls movin' in like cold streams of logic,
And I prayed as the lightning attacked
That something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack,
Something will make it go crack, something will make it go crack.
The palm trees fall into the sea,
It doesn't matter much to me
As long as you're safe, Kimberly.
And I can gaze deep
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, oh.
Oh, in your starry eyes, baby,
Looking deep in your eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby, oh.
Oh, looking deep in your eyes, baby,
Into your starry eyes, baby, looking deep in your eyes, baby
Car stopped in a clearing,
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.
I saw the boy break out of his skin.
My heart turned over and I crawled in.
He cried, "Break it up, oh I don't understand,
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,
I'm not listening."
Snow started falling,
I could hear the angel calling.
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.
The boy flew away and he started to sing.
He sang, "Break it up, oh, I don't understand.
Break it up, I can't comprehend.
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.
Break it up, don't look at me."
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,
I fell on my knee
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.
I cried, "Take me please!"
Ice, it was shining.
I could feel my heart, it was melting.
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.
I cried, "Break it up, oh, now I understand.
Break it up, and I want to go.
Break it up, oh please take me with you.
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel."
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.
Break it up, break it up, break it up,
Break it up, break it up, break it up,
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up
Break it up, break it up, break it on up
Break it up, break it on up, up, up
Break it, break it, break it, break it
Break it on up, break it up,
Break it up, break it up, break it up ...
The boy was in the hallway drinking a glass of tea
From the other end of the hallway a rhythm was generating
Another boy was sliding up the hallway
He merged perfectly with the hallway,
He merged perfectly, the mirror in the hallway
The boy looked at Johnny, Johnny wanted to run,
but the movie kept moving as planned
The boy took Johnny, he pushed him against the locker,
He drove it in, he drove it home, he drove it deep in Johnny
The boy disappeared, Johnny fell on his knees,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started crashing his head against the locker,
started laughing hysterically
When suddenly Johnny gets the feeling he's being surrounded by
horses, horses, horses, horses
coming in in all directions
white shining silver studs with their nose in flames,
He saw horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses, horses.
Do you know how to pony like bony maroney
Do you know how to twist, well it goes like this, it goes like this
Baby mash potato, do the alligator, do the alligator
And you twist the twister like your baby sister
I want your baby sister, give me your baby sister, dig your baby sister
Rise up on her knees, do the sweet pea, do the sweet pee pee,
Roll down on her back, got to lose control, got to lose control,
Got to lose control and then you take control,
Then you're rolled down on your back and you like it like that,
Like it like that, like it like that, like it like that,
Then you do the watusi, yeah do the watusi
Life is filled with holes, Johnny's laying there, his sperm coffin
Angel looks down at him and says, "Oh, pretty boy,
Can't you show me nothing but surrender?"
Johnny gets up, takes off his leather jacket,
Taped to his chest there's the answer,
You got pen knives and jack knives and
Switchblades preferred, switchblades preferred
Then he cries, then he screams, saying
Life is full of pain, I'm cruisin' through my brain
And I fill my nose with snow and go Rimbaud,
Go Rimbaud, go Rimbaud,
And go Johnny go, and do the watusi, oh do the watusi
There's a little place, a place called space
It's a pretty little place, it's across the tracks,
Across the tracks and the name of the place is you like it like that,
You like it like that, you like it like that, you like it like that,
And the name of the band is the
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes,
Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes, Twistelettes
Baby calm down, better calm down,
In the night, in the eye of the forest
There's a mare black and shining with yellow hair,
I put my fingers through her silken hair and found a stair,
I didn't waste time, I just walked right up and saw that
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
up there -- there is a sea
the sea's the possibility
There is no land but the land
(up there is just a sea of possibilities)
There is no sea but the sea
(up there is a wall of possibilities)
There is no keeper but the key
(up there there are several walls of possibilities)
Except for one who seizes possibilities, one who seizes possibilities.
(up there)
I seize the first possibility, is the sea around me
I was standing there with my legs spread like a sailor
(in a sea of possibilities) I felt his hand on my knee
(on the screen)
And I looked at Johnny and handed him a branch of cold flame
(in the heart of man)
The waves were coming in like Arabian stallions
Gradually lapping into sea horses
He picked up the blade and he pressed it against his smooth throat
(the spoon)
And let it deep in
(the veins)
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening
Dip in to the sea, to the sea of possibilities
It started hardening in my hand
And I felt the arrows of desire
I put my hand inside his cranium, oh we had such a brainiac-amour
But no more, no more, I gotta move from my mind to the area
(go Rimbaud go Rimbaud go Rimbaud)
And go Johnny go and do the watusi,
Yeah do the watusi, do the watusi ...
Shined open coiled snakes white and shiny twirling and encircling
Our lives are now entwined, we will fall yes we're together twining
Your nerves, your mane of the black shining horse
And my fingers all entwined through the air,
I could feel it, it was the hair going through my fingers,
(I feel it I feel it I feel it I feel it)
The hairs were like wires going through my body
I I that's how I
that's how I
I died
(at that Tower of Babel they knew what they were after)
(they knew what they were after)
(Everything on the current) moved up
I tried to stop it, but it was too warm, too unbelievably smooth,
Like playing in the sea, in the sea of possibility, the possibility
Was a blade, a shiny blade, I hold the key to the sea of possibilities
There's no land but the land
looked at my hands, and there's a red stream
that went streaming through the sands like fingers,
like arteries, like fingers
(how much fits between the eyes of a horse?)
He lay, pressing it against his throat (your eyes)
He opened his throat (your eyes)
His vocal chords started shooting like (of a horse) mad pituitary glands
The scream he made (and my heart) was so high (my heart) pitched that nobody heard,
No one heard that cry,
No one heard (Johnny) the butterfly flapping in his throat,
(His fingers)
Nobody heard, he was on that bed, it was like a sea of jelly,
And so he seized the first
(his vocal chords shot up)
(possibility)
(like mad pituitary glands)
It was a black tube, he felt himself disintegrate
(there is nothing happening at all)
and go inside the black tube, so when he looked out into the steep
saw this sweet young thing (Fender one)
Humping on the parking meter, leaning on the parking meter
In the sheets
there was a man
dancing around
to the simple
Rock & roll
song
I just don't know what to do tonight,
My head is aching as I drink and breathe
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.
There must be something I can dream tonight,
The air is filled with the moves of you,
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad
That our friends can't be with us today.
I wanna make a deal with you girl
And get it signed by the heads of state
I wanna make a deal with you girl
Be recognized round the world
It's my
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign it)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
At night I can see the stars on fire
And I can see the world in flames
And it's all because of you girl
Or your thousand other names
Peggy, Carrie Ann and Betty Jean
Jill, Joan, Jan and Sue
Alice, Cindy, Barbara Ann, you know
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl, you know
It's all because of you
It's all because of you girl, you know
It's all because of you, you better sign my
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign it)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact (you better sign)
Non-alignment pact (come on, come on, come on)
Non-alignment pact (leave me alone)
Non-alignment pact (leave me alone)
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact
Non-alignment pact

We can live in the empty spaces of this life
My baby says
Far away the stars are coming all undone

My baby says, But that's far away
And we're young
My baby says
And if the devil comes we'll shoot him with a gun
My baby says
We can live in the empty spaces of this life

In the desert sands
Our hearts are brighter than the sun
My baby says
When the devil comes we'll shoot him with a gun
My baby says
My baby says, And if he shows his face
We'll laugh
I ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round
The things I say hit the air and seem to fall apart
And I can see the faces faces fallin down
And then I'm
Gone
Gone
Gone by her heart
I get a picture of what it'll be like
I turn the channel round to Channel 43
I see electricity jump and spark
I see electricity uh real and stark
And then I'm

Gone by her heart
I ride a street wave right by her side
And I can hear the city city comin round

He'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
And she'll wave her red book
He'll tell her
One way?
I want you all ways
One way
And then they'll sing
I was lost at sea
She was lost with me
Then across the broad horizon
Out on the Big Waves
I saw it coming
I saw the red guard
I saw the new world
I saw the Big Wall
Out on the Big Waves
Hooray!
(That's what I had to say)
Hooray!
We will purify
We must purify
For the sake of that security we all want
We will purify
He'll be the red guard
She'll be the new world
He'll wear his grey cap
She'll wave her red book
Life stinks

I can't think
I like the Kinks
Life stinks

It's pretty cute the way she tucks me in at dawn
And how I pray that I never should sin again
Uh oh
Here it comes
It's goin over my head
It's over my head
In the gas her eyes are imagined
And what she sees cannot be detected
It's over my head
That, she said, and that went by
This, she says, and this may too
Oh no
There it goes
It's over my head

It was the first thing that I saw
Oh, you never see that kind of Classical Girl
Understand that it was the first thing that I saw
That was fate
(It was the ballistics, mon!)
That was fate
It was a world, what a world!
What a world? What a big world
What a world to be drowned in
It's just a joke, mon!

Getting rid of the albatross
Sowing seeds of discontent
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I've seen you up far too close
Getting rid of the albatross
Frying rear blinds
If I wanted
Should I really
If I run away
Run away
Riding along on the crest of the wave
Getting rid of the albatross
Another will not forget
I know you very well
Run away
Run away
Should I
I run away
Getting rid of the albatross
I know you very well
You are unbearable
I see you far too close
If I wanted to
If
Run away
Run away
I ran away
I ran away
You make me feel ashamed
At acting attitudes
Remember ridicule
It should be clear by now
Clear by now
Your words are useless
Full of excuses
False confidence
Someone has used you well
Used you well
I could be wrong
It could be hate
As far as I can see
Clinging desperately
Imagining pretending
No personality
Dragging on and on and on and on
And on and on and on and on
I think you're slightly late
Slightly late
This person's had enough of useless memories
Always remember
Twisted amenities
Could be wrong
This person's had enough
Of useless memories
Always remember
Twisted amenities
Out of order
Out of order
It could be worse
You're losing all the time
I could be wrong
Could be worse
You're losing all the time
I let you stay too long
I could be wrong
Could be wrong
Whatever pass
Could never last
All in your mind
Where it all began
You're doing wrong
It's not the movies
And you're old
Seeing in your eyes
Words can never say the way
Told me in your eyes
Final in a fade
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Never really know, never realize
Silence in your eyes
Silence in your eyes
Never really know, till it's gone away
Never realize
The silence in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Seen it in your eyes
Never no more hope away
Final in a fade
Watch her slowly die
Saw it in her eyes
Choking on a bed
Flowers rotting dead
Seen it in her eyes
Ending in a day
Silence was a way
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
Seeing in your eyes
I'm seeing through my eyes
Words cannot express...
Drive to the forest in a Japanese car
The smell of rubber on country tar
Hindsight done me no good
Standing naked in this back of the woods
The cassette played poptones
I can't forget the impression you made
You left a hole in the back of my head
I don't like hiding in this foliage and peat
It's wet and I'm losing my body heat
The cassette played poptones
This bleeding heart
Looking for bodies
Nearly injured my pride
Praise picnicking in the British countryside
Poptones
A face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living
He's been careering
The steady hand as planned
Behind the reasoning
No claim for property
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Is this living
He's been careering
Trigger machinery
Mangle the military
No one should be there
Is this living
Blown into breeze
Scatter concrete
The jagged metal bad life
Manufactured
He's been careering
Is this living
A face is raining
Across the border
The pride of history
The same as murder
Is this living careering
There must be meaning
Behind the moaning
Spreading tales
Like coffin nails
Is this living
He's been careering
It's raining
I need to hide
Trigger machinery
I've been careering
Across the border
Is this living
Both sides of the river
There is bacteria
Armoured machinery mangled
This could be heaven
Shallow spreads of ordered lawns
I like the illusion, illusion of privacy
The careful trees blending so perfectly
Bland planned idle luxury
Life in lovely allotted slots
A token nice, a nice constitution
A layered mass of subtle props
This could be heaven
Mild mannered mews
Well intentioned rules to dignify a daily code
Lawful order standard views
This could be heaven
It is your character
Deep in your nature
Take one example
Sample and hold
Romance and replace
The lack in yourself
It's your nature
It's your nature
We see you climbing
Improving the effort
Wearing my suit
It is your character
There is a limit
Over your shoulder
Everyone loves you
Until they know you
Perfume aerosols
May champion the strangers
Nick
Standing around
All the right people
Crawling
Tennis on Tuesday
The ladder is long
It is your nature
You've gotta suntan
Football on Sunday
Society boy
On Social Security
It is your nature
Tennis on Tuesday
Sipping champagne
Football on Sunday
Home on the train
It is your nature
Girl from Totteridge Park
Said you were nice
So was my suit
The ladder is long
Nearly ten thirty, I'm rising early
I've got an eye to buy the best
Before the rush
Someone left a baby in the car park
Never any reason
Don't you listen
One more sob story
Someone is calling
Seen through the window
Calling through mirrors
Don't you listen, don't interfere
Ignore it and it will go away
Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listen
Someone is calling
Don't you listen, don't you listen
Voice moaning in a speaker
Never really get too close
Only a gimmick, pointed fingers
Never more serious sight
Wouldn't waste the effort on entertainment
Out of control, mob running wild
All you ever get is all you steal
Side of London that the tourists never see
Angle ambience
Chant
Don't know why I bother
There's nothing in it for me
The more I see the less I get
The likes of you and me are an embarrassment
Chant
It's not important
It's not worth a mention in the Guardian
Every librarian has its theory
Chant chant angle ambience
Chant
Voice moaning in a speaker
Chant
Hey ho, let's go
Hey ho, let's go

Hooray for Havana!
Next time I'll listen to my heart
Next time, well I'll be smart
That girl could still be mine
But I'm tired of the hurt
Tired of tryin'
I'm tired of the pain
Tired of tryin'
I'm tired of cryin'
If you think you can, well come on man
I was a Green Beret in Viet Nam
No more of your fairy stories
'Cause I got my other worries
53rd and 3rd
Standing on the street
53rd and 3rd
I'm tryin' to turn a trick
53rd and 3rd
You're the one they never pick
53rd and 3rd
Don't it make you feel sick?
Then I took out my razor blade
Then I did what God forbade
Now the cops are after me
But I proved that I'm no sissy
Hey baby won't you take a chance?
Say that you'll let me have this dance?
Well let's dance; let's dance.
We'll do the twist, the stomp, the mashed potato too.
Any old dance that you wanna do.
Well let's dance; let's dance.
Hey baby yeah you thrill the soul, hold me close, don't you let me go.
Well let's dance.
Hey baby if you're all alone, baby you'll let me walk you home.
Let's dance.
Hey baby yeah you swing it right, yes I know that tonight's the night.
Let's dance.
I don't wanna walk around with you
I don't wanna walk around with you
I don't wanna walk around with you
So why you wanna walk around with me?
I don't wanna walk around with you
I'm a shock trooper in a stupor
Yes I am.
I'm a Nazi schatze
Y'know I fight for fatherland
Little German boy
Being pushed around
Little German boy
In a German town
Today your love, tomorrow the world
I was a child
Who wanted love that was wild
Though tight as slow motion
But crazed with devotion
Insane with devotion
A whole other notion
I was fourteen and a half
And it wasn't no laugh
Love comes in spurts - oh no it hurts
Love comes in spurts - it hurts
Love comes in spurts - oh no, cause
Love comes in spurts - it always hurts
I just can't get wise
To those tragical lies
Though I now know the facts
They still cut like an axe
Cause love comes in spurts
In dangerous flirts
And it murders your heart
They didn't tell you that part
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Love comes in spurts
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Look out liars and you highlife scum
Who gotta keep your victims poor and dumb
Your motives and your methods are not disguised
By your silk, soap, sex, or your smiling lies
Your lies
Your lies
Look out here
You pompous jerk
Look out here
I'll go berserk
Well I guess you put me in my place
But I won't forget your stupid face
They gave you power cause they knew your needs
Soprano boys get talent when you shoot your seeds
Your seeds
Your seeds
Well you laugh to hear what your best friends say
Old man they laugh when you walk away
Away
Away
Look out chief
Ridiculous creep
Look out thief
You'll lose your teeth
Well you got power, now there's competition
And your blind side's turned to the boys with a mission
You were sixty-five when you wiggled out
Your mind all twisted and your mom all shout
I'm a man with his share of excess nice
But it can't be spared for drooling lice
Look out jerk
You ancient slut
I can't endure
Your smirking smut
Well life is short so don't even try
To bother waving as we pass you by
Your mind's a wreck but that's fine
It corresponds to mine
We're in a room the door closes
Automatic aut- (hypnosis) -matic automatic auto-
New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure
Too weak for life you have become
You can't get dressed you're too numb
But we assume sublime poses
Deep in true to life (hypnosis) true to life in true to life in
New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure
You're in too deep you can't survive
Or can't be you past twenty-five
A day's a week the monster dozes
Deep in passionate (hypnosis) passionate in passionate in
New pleasure, new pleasure
(Whisper in my ear, we go away)
New Pleasure, new pleasure
Betrayal takes two. Who did it to who?
I mean: not to be cut by your dull point of view
Feelings will change - we're helpless they must
We like it that way - eliminates trust
But that cut on your arm where the blood is still fresh
And the thought of some harm that comes to yourself...
Hey sweetheart cool off, you're not so distraught...
You lost what you had but that's what I've got
I'll close my eyes while you take off my clothes
No wait a while till this feelings goes...
The feeling gets stronger, two times emptiness-
We'll embrace that much longer, make more of a mess...
The senstation of life was aroused in ourself
From the plot we digressed, knocked the books off the shelves
Then burned down the house, then met in a bar
With a motel attached and kissed all the scars
We're changed now for good, but I try to insert
My face to appear when you love when you flirt...
Partner don you pull no gun
Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun
Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one
Down at the rock and roll club
They say Richard are you gonna go out tonite?
Well I am uncetain I ain't feelin too right
But i rip up my shirt
Watch the mirror it flirt
Yeah, I'm goin out, out, inta sight
Partner don you pull no gun
Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun
Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one
Down at the rock and roll club
On the street air is thin, dim night like the rest
At the door of the club loungin eyes so undressed
Then you open the door
And the noise shakes the floor
Oh baby night after night here tonight is the best
Partner don you pull no gun
Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun
Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one
Down at the rock and roll club
I say Hey how's the group, when's the set gonna start?
She says I know that girl - there's a tattoo on her heart
She pivots in rage
And the band hits the stage
Sexy love ricochets round everyone's part
Partner don you pull no gun
Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun
Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one
Down at the rock and roll club
I say everybody's waitin - I want moments like these
Oh baby get me drunk I'll go to my knees
Such a surge overload
Oh the whold joint explode
Everyone you ever saw indulgin in squeeze
Partner don you pull no gun
Down at the rock and roll club
We just gonna have some fun
Down at the rock and roll club
Sweetheart would you buy me one
Down at the rock and roll club
I saw what I had so
I got I got mad so
I guess I went bad so
Now I search for new endeavors
Push my buttons wear my levers
Who says it's good to good to be alive
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good, it's a perpetual dive
There's nothing to win by
This sort of an outcry
Oh yeah, we all know why
'cause the world a person lives in is his brain
Well, mine just gives in
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive
It's clear that I choose to
Live on I'm so used to...
But still it ain't news to ditch it
Say when one incentive's gained and gone
Though you're inventive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive
Once born you're addicted
And so you depict it
As good, but who kicked it?
Users just can't see the horror
Tell one if you want to bore her
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
Same ones who keep it a perpetual jive
Who says it's good to good to be alive?
It ain't no good it's a perpetual dive
I was saying "let me out of here" before I was even born
It's such a gamble when you get a face
It's fascinating to observe what the mirror does, but
When I dine, it's for the wall that I set a place
I belong to the Blank Generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the ... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
Triangles were falling out the window as the doctor cursed
He was a cartoon, long forsaken by the public eye
The nurse adjusted her garters as I breathed my first
The doctor grabbed my throat and yelled, "God's consolation prize!"
I belong to the Blank Generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the ... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time, take it
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
To hold the TV to my lips, the air so packed with cash
Then carry it up flights of stairs and drop it in the vacant lot
To lose my train of thought and fall into your arms' tracks
And watch beneath the eyelids every passing dot
I belong to the Blank Generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the ... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
I belong to the Blank Generation, and
I can take it or leave it each time, well
I belong to the ... generation, but
I can take it or leave it each time
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, wee-ooh
Late last night, I went for a walk
Down by the river near my home
Couldn't believe with my own eyes
And I swear I'll never leave my home again
I saw a man walking on the water
Coming right at me from the other side
Calling out my name, "Do not be afraid"
Feet begin to run, pounding in my brain
I don't wanna go
I don't wanna go
No, no, no, no, no
I don't wanna go
I withdrew from the street and all humanlike zones
I'd had it, I'd had it - I was mush to the bones
I covered the windows, I was taking no calls
Then I thought for a month inside the alien walls
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
I called up a girl I'd known for so many years
I'd seen her in shock, I'd seen the last of her tears
I admired her style from her toes to her brain -
She accepted my plan and so she caught the next train
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
We would secretly smile inside our surgical masks
But we were serious too - we accomplished our task
The schedule was followed, a daughter was born
And so the mother departed - I was left with her form
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
Her education's begun - I'm intent on success
Her breathtaking beauty it brings out my best
I once knew true love - she won't know another
Life is renewed, my little girl is my lover
Now I know oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know, oh
They don't tell you so
Now I know. Oh
They don't tell you so
But I can recall it all
Head wrapped in your hair
In a box lined with silk
You can't learn to talk
And the air is your milk
Erasing my face
I want you so bad
I want to be you
It's futile it's sad
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
Muscle against silk
Tears fall from the burn
A smell of perfume
In a moment you'll turn
In a moment you'll turn
Your face will change shape
We exchange just one gift:
To see like an ape
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
Not this one
Oh so easy to go
Drawn in the vacuum
At the time I'm in you
I'm alone in the back room
Down to the last raw
My eyes open wide
To collect all the scraps
Ten more years and they'll cry
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh, oh baby
Oh oh oh
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
I could live with you in another world
Cheap holiday in other peoples misery
I don't wanna holiday in the sun
I wanna go to the new Belsen
I wanna see some history
Cause now I got a reasonable economy
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall
In sensurround sound in a two inch wall
I was waiting for the communist call
I didn't ask for sunshine and I got World War three
I'm looking over the wall and they're looking at me
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason and I'm still waiting
Now I got a reason
Now I got a reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall
They're staring all night
And they're staring all day
I had no reason to be here at all
And now I got a reason
It's no real reason
And I'm waiting
The Berlin wall
I got to go over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
Claustrophobia there's too much paranoia
There's too many closets
So when will we fall
And now I gotta reason
It's no real reason to be waiting
The Berlin wall
I got to go over the wall
I don't understand this thing at all
This third rate B movie show
Cheap dialogue
Cheap essential scenery
I got to go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin wall
Before they come over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
I'm gonna go over the wall
I wanna go over the Berlin wall
I'm gonna go over the Berlin wall
Before they come over the Berlin wall
I don't understand this thing at all
Please don't be waiting for me
She was a girl from Birmingham
She just had an abortion
She was case of insanity
Her name was Pauline, she lived in a tree
She was a no one who killed her baby
She sent her letters from the country
She was an animal
She was a bloody disgrace
Body! I'm not an animal
Body! I'm not an animal

In a packet in a lavatory
Die little baby screaming
Body screaming fucking bloody mess
Not an animal

Body! I'm not animal
Mummy! I'm not an abortion
Throbbing squirm,
gurgling bloody mess
I'm not a discharge

And sir and friends are crucified
A day they wished that we had died
We are an addition
We are ruled by none
Never ever never
And you thought that we were faking
That we were all just money making
You do not believe we're for real
Or you would lose your cheap appeal?
Don't judge a book just by the cover
Unless you cover just another
And blind acceptance is a sign
Of stupid fools who stand in line

Hello E.M.I
Goodbye A & M
From the cradle bars
Comes a beckoning voice
It sends you spinning
You have no choice...
You hear laughter
Cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning
You have no choice...
Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
And don't forget
When your elders forget
To say their prayers
Take them by the legs
And throw them down the stairs
When you think
Your toys have gone berserk
An' it's an illusion
You cannot shirk
You hear laughter
Cracking through the walls
It sends you spinning
You have no choice
Following the footsteps
Of a rag doll dance
We are entranced
Spellbound
Into the line
I see it fine
Into the line
Our hearts entwine
Remember when
Your time again
Remember when
Your time again
Standing in the light
Always sitting on the line
Never on a side
Always wanting to be right
Standing in the light
I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light
And blinded by the sight
Into the light...
Into the light
I see it fight
Into the light
A new horizon
Bleached into white
Kept out of sight
Bleached into white
Kept out of sight
Standing in the light
Always sitting on the line
Never on a side
Pushing out the light
Standing in the light
I never wanted to be right
Now I'm attracted by the light
And blinded by the sight
Into the light'
Dead ahead in the night
Burning in the light
And knowing that it's right
Driving in the night...
Into the light...
The jewel, the prize
Looking into your eyes
Cool pools drown your mind
What else will you find
I heard a rumour -- it was just a rumour
I heard a rumour -- what have you done to her
Myriad lights -- they said I'd be impressed
Arabian Knights -- at your primitive best
A tourist oasis -- reflects in seedy sunshades
A monstrous oil tanker
Its wound bleeding in seas
I heard a rumour -- what have you done to her
I heard a rumour -- what have you done to her
Veiled behind screens
Kept as your baby machine
Whilst you conquer more orifices
Of boys, goats and things
Ripped out sheeps' eyes -- no forks or knives
Myriad lights -- they said I'd be impressed
Arabian Knights -- at your primitive best
The night is still
And the frost, it bites my face
I wear my silence like a mask
And murmur like a ghost
"Trick or treat"
"Trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
The carefree days are distant now
I wear my memories like a shroud
I try to speak, but words collapse
Echoing, "Trick or treat"
"Trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
I wander through your sadness
Gazing at you with scorpion eyes
Halloween... Halloween
A sweet reminder in the ice-blue nursery
Of a childish murder of hidden lustre
And she cries, "Trick or treat"
"Trick or treat"
The bitter and the sweet
I wander through your sadness
Gazing at you with scorpion eyes
Halloween... Halloween
Monitor outside
For the people inside
A prevention of crime
A passing of time
They come and they go
It's a passing of time
They come and they go
Whilst we sit in our homes
Sit back and enjoy
The real McCoy
Our new air of authority
Our sentinel of misery
His face was full of intent
And we shook with excitement
Then the victim stared up
Looked strangely at the screen
As if her pain was our fault
But that's entertainment
What we crave for inside
No more second rate movies
From those people outside
Only at night time I see you
In darkness I feel you
A bride by my side -- I'm inside many brides
Sometimes I wonder...
What goes on in your mind, always silent and kind
Unlike the others...
Fuck the mothers kill the others
Fuck the others kill the mothers
I'll put it out of my mind because...
I'm out of my mind with you
In heaven and hell with you...
My Night Shift sisters
Await your nightly visitor
They don't bother me
No they don't bother me
The cold marble slab submits at my feet
With a neat dissection...
Looking so sweet to me -- please come to me
With your cold flesh -- my cold love
Hissing -- not kissing
A happy go lucky chap -- always dressed in black
He'll come to you, he'll come to you
My Night Shift sisters
With your nightly visitor
A new vocation in life
My love with a knife
Fuck the mothers kill the others
Fuck the others kill the mothers
I'll put it out of my mind because...
I'm out of my mind with you
In heaven and hell with you...
Sin in my heart
Sin in my heart...
Sin in my heart flying like a dart
Oh sin in my heart
It's beginning to start...
When you're lying like a tart
Oh sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet
Oh sin in my heart
It's short and sweet
Sin in my heart...
Swift as a dart sin in my heart
Oh sin in my heart
When you grovel at my feet
Keep it short and sweet
Sin in my heart...
The head is the best part
My headcut my woodcut
I saw you in the gallery
With your torso and family
A huge smiling central face
With eyes and lips cut out
But smiling and eating
Lots of other lips...
A beautiful mask in plastercast
Such a beautiful mask in plastercast
Can I take it back with me?
Back to the flat with me?
Oh severed head
I'll feed your head with bread
And paint your lips bright red
I'll keep it fresh on ice
It will look very nice
Can I take it back with me
Back to the flat with me
Shrunken heads under the bed
The flies are humming
There's a red under the bed
The spit is turning
Roasting burning
Shadows dancing -- by the fire
Flickering flames laugh -- with desire
The head is the best part
My headcut my woodcut
She's your little voodoo dolly,
and she's gonna make you lazy;
Like the little drum in your ear
transfixes you to your fear,
And now she's transfixed in your fear,
And you know she's gonna stay there...
Because her nails are deep in your hair,
And she made you so... unaware...
Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer...
Like that little drum in your ear,
Transfixes you to your fear...
She's such an ugly little dolly,
And she's making you look very silly...
When you listen in to her ear,
You get paralyzed with her fear...
Oh, down... down... down, down in your fear...
Down... down... down, down in your fear...
Now this little voodoo dolly
Has made you very lazy...
You're anaemic from her sucking,
And when you're dead, she'll find another...
Better break that little dolly,
And sling her in the corner...
Now she's a sorry little dolly!
Such a sorry little dolly!
Are you listening to your fear?
The beat is coming nearer...
Like that little drum in your ear
Transfixes you to your fear...
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
Listen, listen, listen, listen,
Listen! Listen, listen!
Listen to your fear...
Listen!
Listen!
Lis-listen!
Lis-listen!
Lis-listen!
Listen!
Listen!
Listen... to your fear...
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
(Listen to your fear.
Listen to your fear.)
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen to your fear, oh...
Listen! Listen!
Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
Listen! Listen!
She...
She...
She...
She...
She...
She...
She...

She...
She's your little voodoo dolly...
Take a look at these hands.
Take a look at these hands.
The hand speaks. The hand of a government man.
Well I'm a tumbler. Born under punches.
I'm so thin.
All I want is to breathe I'm too thin
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space, so we can move in-between In-Between it
And keep on step ahead, of yourself.
Don't you miss it, don't you miss it.
Some 'a you people just about missed it!
Last time to make plans!
Well I'm a tumbler...

Falling bodies tuble 'cross the floor Well I'm a tumbler!
When you get to where you wanna be Thank you! Thank you!
When you get to where you wanna be Don't even mention it!
Take a look at these hands. They're passing in-between us.
Take a look at these hands
Take a look at these hands. You don't have to mention it.
No thanks. I'm a Government Man.
And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...
And the heat goes on...Where the hand has been...And the heat goes
on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes
on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes on...And the heat goes
on...Where the hand has been...And the heat goes on...And the heat

I'm not a drowning man!
And I'm not a burning building! (I'm a tumbler!)
Drowning cannot hurt a man!
Fire cannot hurt a man. (Not the Government Man.)
All I want is to breathe Thank you. Thank you
Won't you breathe with me?
Find a little space...So we move in-between I'm so thin
And keep one step ahead of yourself. I'm catching up with myself
All I want it to breathe

Lost my shape - trying to act casual!
Can't stop - I might end up in the hospital
I'm changing my shape - I feel like an accident
They're back! - to explain their experience
Isn't it weird
Looks too obscure to me
Wasteing away
And that was their policy
I'm ready to leave
I push the fact in front of me
Facts lost - facts are never what they seem to be
Nothing there! No information left of any kind
Lifting my head
Looking for danger signs
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us
There was a line
There was a formula
Sharp as a knife
Facts cut a hole in us
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...
The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside
The island of doubt
It's like the taste of medicine
Working by hindsight
Got the message from the oxygen
Making a list
Find the cost of opportunity
Doing it right
Facts are useless in emergencies
The feeling returns
Whenever we close our eyes
Lifting my head
Looking around inside
Facts are simple and facts are straight
Facts are lazy and facts are late
Facts all come with points of view
Facts don't do what I want them to
Facts just twist the truth around
Facts are living turned inside out
Facts are getting the best of them
Facts are nothing on the face of things
Facts don't stain the furniture
Facts go out and slam the door
Facts are written all over your face
Facts continue to change their shape
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...
I'm still waiting...I'm still waiting...

And you may find yourself living in a shotgun shack
And you may find yourself in another part of the world
And you may find yourself behind the wheel of a large automobile
And you may find yourself in a beautiful house, with a beautiful wife
And you may ask yourself, "Well... how did I get here?"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself, "How do I work this?"
And you may ask yourself, "Where is that large automobile?"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful house"
And you may tell yourself, "This is not my beautiful wife"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Water dissolving and water removing
There is water at the bottom of the ocean
Under the water, carry the water
Remove the water at the bottom of the ocean
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
And you may ask yourself, "What is that beautiful house?"
And you may ask yourself, "Where does that highway go to?"
And you may ask yourself, "Am I right? Am I wrong?"
And you may say to yourself, "My God! What have I done?"
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again, into the silent water
Under the rocks and stones, there is water underground
Letting the days go by, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by, water flowing underground
Into the blue again after the money's gone
Once in a lifetime, water flowing underground
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was and look where my hand was
Time isn't holding up, time isn't after us
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Letting the days go by, same as it ever was
Here a twister comes, here comes the twister
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Same as it ever was, same as it ever was
Once in a lifetime, let the water hold me down
Letting the days go by
For a long time I felt without style or grace
Wearing shoes with no socks in cold weather
I knew my heart was in the right place
I knew I'd be able to do these things.
And as we watch him digging his own grave
It is important to know that was where he's at
He can't afford to stop...That is what he believe
He'll keep on digging for a thousand years.
I'm walking a line-I'm thining about empty motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
You notice there's nothing around you, around you
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
Never get to say much, never get to talk
Tell us a little bit, but not too much
Right about then, is where she give up
She has closed her eyes, she has give up hope
I'm walking a line-I hate to be dreaming in motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
I'm keeping my fingers behind me, 'hind me
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
I turn myself around, I'm moving backwards and forwards
I'm moving twice as much as I was before
I'll keep on digging to the center of the Earth
I'll be down in there moving the in the room...
I'm walking a line-Visiting houses in motion
I'm walking a line-Just barely enough to be living
Get outa the way-No time to begin
This isn't the time-So nothing was done
Not talking about-Not many at all
I'm turning around-No trouble at all
Two different houses surround you, 'round you
I'm walking a line-Divide and dissolve.
He would see faces in movies, on T.V., in magazines, and in books....
He thought that some of these faces might be right for him....And
through the years, by keeing an ideal facial structure fixed in his
mind....Or somewhere in the back of his mind....That he might, by
force of will, cause his face to approach those of his ideal....The
change would be very subtle....It might take ten years or so....
Gradually his face would change its' shape....A more hooked nose...
Wider, thinner lips....Beady eyes....A larger forehead.
He imagined that this was an ability he shared with most other
people....They had also molded their faced according to some
ideal....Maybe they imagined that their new face would better
suit their personality....Or maybe they imagined that their
personality would be forced to change to fit the new appear-
ance....This is why first impressions are often correct...
Although some people might have made mistakes....They may have
arrived at an appearance that bears no relationship to them....
They may have picked an ideal appearance based on some childish
whim, or momentary impulse....Some may have gotten half-way
there, and then changed their minds.
He wonders if he too might have made a similar mistake.
Mojique sees his village from a nearby hill
Mojique thinks of days before Americans came
He sees the foreigners in growing numbers
He sees the foreigners in fancy houses
He thinks of days that he can still remember...now.
Mojique holds a package in his quivering hands
Mojique sends the package to the American man
Softly he glides along the streets and alleys
Up comes the wind that makes them run for cover
He feels the time is surely now or never...more.
The wind in my heart
The wind in my heart
The dust in my head
The dust in my head
The wind in my heart
The wind in my heart
(Come to) Drive them away
Drive them away.u
Mojique buys equipment in the market place
Mojique plants devices in the free trade zone
He feels the wind is lifting up his people
He calls the wind to guide him on his mission
He knows his friend the wind is always standing...by.
Mojique smells the wind that comes from far away
Mojique waits for news in a quiet place
He feels the presence of the wind around him
He feels the power of the past behind him
He has the knowledge of the wind to guide him...on.
The wind in my heart
The wind in my heart
The dust in my head
The dust in my head
The wind in my heart
The wind in my heart
(Come to) Drive them away
Drive them away.
A terrible signal
Too weak to even recognize
A gentle collapsing
The removal of the insides
I'm touched by your pleas
I value these moments
We're older than we realize
...in someone's eyes
A frequent returning
And leaving unnoticed
A condition of mercy
A change in the weather
A view to remember
The center is missing
They question how the future lies
...in someone's eyes
The gentle collapsing
Of every surface
We travel on the quiet road
...the overload
What I want I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow"
I want to fly, fly up a fountain
I want to jump, jump, jump, jump a mountain
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
It seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I get ideas, I get a notion
I want a nice little boat made out of ocean
I get your point, you're so sharp
Getting good reactions with your evil talk
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
It seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil
Don't say unconscious, no don't say doom
Well, if you got to say it, I've got to leave this room
'Cause what I want I want now
And it's a whole lot more than "anyhow", get it?
I understand all (I see no)
Destructive urges (I see no)
It seems so perfect (I see no)
I see, I see no evil
I'm running wild with the one I love (I see no evil)
I'm going crazy with the one I love (I see no evil)
I keep it crazy with the one I love (I see no evil)
Keep it totally cool with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Keep it wild with the one you love (I see no evil)
Combine your future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love (I see no evil)
Pull down the future with the one you love
It was a tight toy night, streets so bright
The world was so thin between my bones and skin
There stood another person who was a little surprised
To be face to face with a world so alive
How I fell (Did ya feel low?)
Nah (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo
You know it's all like some new kind of drug
My senses are sharp and my hands are like gloves
Broadway looked so medieval, it seemed to flap like little pages
And I fell sideways laughing with a friend from many stages
How we felt (Did ya feel low?)
Not at all (Huh?)
I fell right into the arms of Venus de Milo
Suddenly my eyes went so soft and shaky
Oh I knew there was pain but pain is not aching
Then Richie, Richie said
"Hey man, let's dress up like cops, think of what we could do"
But something, something, it said, "You better not"
And I fell (Did ya feel low?)
Nah (Huh?)
I stood up, walked out of the arms of Venus de Milo
I knew it musta been some big set-up
All the action just would not let up
It's just a little bit back from the main road
Where the silence spreads and the men dig holes
I start to spin the tale
You complain of my diction
You give me friction (Friction)
But I dig friction (Friction)
You give me friction (Friction)
My eyes are like telescopes
I see it all backwards, but who wants hope?
If I ever catch that ventriloquist
I'll squeeze his head right into my fist
Something comes tracking down
What is the, what's the prediction?
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction)
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction)
I'll betcha it's friction (Friction)
How does a snake get out of its skin?
Here's a depiction
Stop this head motion, set the sails
You know all us boys gonna wind up in jail
I don't wanna grow up
There's too much contradiction
And too much friction (Friction)
But I dig friction (Friction)
Well I'm crazy about friction (Friction)
F-R-I-C-T-I-O-N
Friction
Friction
Friction
I remember how the darkness doubled
I recall lightnin' struck itself
I was listenin', listenin' to the rain
I was hearing, hearing something else
Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
Just waiting
I spoke to a man down at the tracks
And I asked him how he don't go mad
He said "Look here junior, don't you be so happy
And for Heaven's sake, don't you be so sad"
Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
Hesitating
Well a Cadillac, it pulled out of the graveyard
Pulled up to me, all they said "get in" ("get in")
Then the Cadillac, it puttered back into the graveyard
Me, I got out again
Life in the hive puckered up my night
The kiss of death, the embrace of life
There I stand 'neath the marquee moon
I ain't waiting, uh-uh
I remember how the darkness doubled
I recall lightning struck itself
I was listening, listening to the rain
I was hearing, hearing something else
The last word is the lost word
Why don't you say so? Say so
I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Now you give me no trouble and you give me no help
It is the clown that works so well
I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Our lips are sealed, our breath is burning
These cold, wild seas have left us turning
But I sleep light on these shores tonight
I live light on these shores
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Elevation, don't go to my head
Do I, do I
Belong to the night
Only, only
Only tonight
All the ladies stay inside
Time may freeze, a world could cry
All this night running loud
I hear the whispers, and I hear the shouts
And though they never cry for help
Tell me who sends these
Infamous gifts
To make such a promise
And make such a slip
Oh no, can't pull a trick
Never the rose without the prick
Oh, but tell me how do I say
I woke up and it's yesterday
Do I again face this night
Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nights
Darling, darling
Do we part like the seas
The roaring shell
The drifting of the leaves
But all intent remains unknown
It's time to sit up, sit up in the throne
It's seen before, but it's always new
So look close and see who's come through
Never again to face this night
Guiding light, guiding light
Guiding through these nights
The docks, the clocks
A whisper woke him up
The smell of water would resume
The cave, the waves
Of light, the unreal night
That flat curving of a room
Prove it
Just the facts
The confidential
This case, this case, this case that I
I've been workin' on so long, so long
First you creep, then you leap
Up about a hundred feet
You're in so deep
That you could write a book
Chirp, chirp
The birds
They're giving you the words
The world is just a feeling you undertook
Prove it
Just the facts
The confidential
This case, this case, this case that I
I've been workin' on so long, so long
Now the rose
It slows
You in such colorless clothes
Fantastic! You lose your sense of human
Project
Protect
It's warm and it's calm and it's perfect
It's too, too, too
To put a finger on
Prove it
Just the facts
The confidential
This case, this case, this case that I
I've been workin' on so long, so long
This case is closed
Torn curtain reveals another play
Torn curtain, such an expose
I'm uncertain when beauty meets abuse
Torn curtain loves all ridicule
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Flowing by like tears
(Tears, tears) Holding back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before
Torn curtain, giving me the glance
Torn curtain is bringing on the trance
I'm not hurting, holding to the thread
Torn curtain lifts me on the tread
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling by like years
(Years, years) The tears I never shed
Torn curtain feels more like a rake
Torn curtain, how much does it take?
Burn it down...
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) Holding back the tears
(Tears, tears) Rolling back the years
(Years, years) The years I've seen before
(Tears, tears)
(Years, years)
...
Now Little Johnny Jewel
Oh, he's so cool
He has no decision
He's just trying to tell a vision
But some thought that this was sad
And others thought it mad
They just scratching the surface
JJ can do the floor kiss
Was he on display?
No, no, not today
All that guy ever said
He said, "I want my little wing-head"
He half-asleep at night
Over his head, sensation of flight
And he wake up dreaming
Dreaming...
And he run down to the airport
The rush. The roar
And he crouched down behind a fence
With a chest full of lights
Then...
He loses his senses
Oh, Little Johnny Jewel
He's so cool
But if you see him looking lost
You ain't gotta come on so boss
And you know that he's paid
You know that he's paid the price
All you gotta do for that guy
Is wink your eye

Our life together is a hollow tooth
Spit out the shells, spit out the shells
You know exactly what we're talking about
Don't drag your orchestra into this thing
Just rattle your sticks, rattle your sticks
The sound is beautiful, it's perfect
The sound of her young legs in stockings
Rhythm of the walk, it's beautiful
Just let it twist, let it break
Let it buckle, let it bend
I wanna hear the noise of my...

My body is a monster driven insane
My heart is a fish toasted in flame
I kiss the hem of her skirt
My life is a box full of dirt
We spend our life in a box full of dirt
I murder her dress 'til hurts
If there's one thing I desire in this world
And that's to make love to my...
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
The sound is beautiful, it's perfect
I call out her name in the night
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
I call her by her family name
Zoo-music girl, zoo-music girl
Oh God, please let me die beneath her fists

What has not got my heart in it shall we be dubbed sir names
Wither million blither tongues mounting bristling guilt frames
In the fake-ache of the gloom loom slippers slap me alive!
The hour hands down a miracle to spend with ugly types
So we catch and thread a minstrel
Bleed a tower down to its ankles
So we can't go up or stay up
Find the thumb dumb in your ear brain
Get unfunny, such as choirs do
Why the clocklock bought up this one
Just when things seemed so paperparrent
Like my toothface?
Like my out-do?
Capers

Oh a streak, o'treacly ink-inks
Tied my knees all up in elbows
Erase that lapsing smile tub
Lose the slip of the small soap-fellows
Account the add ups till I do-nots
Are we balanced?
We're in business!
Idle tidal, rush in, tried all with a limb's all legs and armour
I had a dreadful diehood
Diehard, drunken, sunken, monk-heart
Oh, I had a wonderful diehood thanks to my fa, fa, family

I am a figure of fun
Obsessive, dead-pan and moribund
Green at the gills, seasick
I am a figure of fun
Innocent, I baked in the sun
I have no luck in love
I have no luck in anything
I am a figure of fun
And I'm impressed by everyone
But I impress no-one
It's irritating
I am a figure of fun

I have money

King Ink strolls into town
He sniffs around
King Ink kicks off his stink-boot
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and
He's much bigger than you think
King Ink
Well, king Ink
A King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a get up, a get up, get up, get up
Up, up, up...
A bug crawls up the wall
King Ink feels like a bug
And he hates his rotten shell
He says: "cha-cha-cha..."
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a King Ink
A wake up, a King Ink
A get up, a get up, a get up, a get up, a get up
What's in that room?

Say something, express thyself, say something, express yourself
Express, say something loudly, ah
A what's in that room?
What's in that house?
Sand and soot and dust and dirt and sand and soot and dust and dirt
And d-d-d-d-d-dirt
Di-di-di-di-di-di-di, di-di-di-di-di-dirt
King Ink feels like a bug
Swimming in a soup-bowl
He says "Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh what a wonderful life
Oh yeah, oh yeah, Fats Domino on the radio

This is true
Oh, this is true, it's true
Mister forever said nothing said
I can sing
Hit it
And make it a dead one
With words like, with words like
Blood and soldier and mother
Ok, ok
I want to, I wanna sleep before the end
Which is most impolite
Hit it
Make it a dead one
If nothing crops up
I'll give you a ring
You can sing the end
Ok, ok
Then I could get
All the little animals out of my room
Hit it
With a broom, with a broom!
Ok, ok, ok, ok
Put them in a big white sack
No visitors came
Hit it
With words like
Like hit it
Like hit it
Oh yeah
Yeah hit it, yeah hit it like, like, like hit it
Thou thou shalt not um like
Thou shalt not
This is the end
This, this really is the living end
This really is the living end
Like really, this is the end and it's still living
In our yard
How many chickens can we count
On our fingers and toes
On their toes
Sitting on father's hole
Sitting on his chest
Crushing rocks of dirt
The earth is soft in our
Yard yard
Stones in my shoes
And feet
Dragging them through museums
Where
Under glass
Refridgerate
Freeze
Hands and feet
And knobbly knees
Yard yard
The light from the window
Falls on the floor
And after it breaks
I cut my feet
On the little bright pieces
I glow in the dark
But only when night falls
It's falling, it's falling, it's falling, it's falling
It falls
My head is a night-club
Club-clubbed to dull drums
Beating too slow
To dance or to breathe or to dance
I insist that you cut in
I a la flambe
I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking, I'm drinking
I'm drunk
Dull day...
First: I tried to kill it with a hammer
Thought that I could lose the head
Sure! we've eaten off the silver
When even food was against us
And then I tried to kill it in the bed!
Second: I gagged it with a pillow
But awoke the nuns inside my head
They pounded their goddy-goddy fists
From the inside - so from the outside
I got good: I stuck it... dead!
Thirdly: I put my lips upon it
And blew a frost across its flat
I wrote upon it's outside-surface
Tonight we're on the outside-surface
Just you and me girl, you and me and the fat!...
Blundertown is drowned in no brainstorm
Smothered in mud at the foot of the river
The color vague is slapped around stupid
Blood dries to a very dull color
I'm drowning and there is no relief from
It's only 12,000 miles to heaven
But the car is broken and we're all well-spoken
I've met three people but I don't think they like me
And we all talk about the state of the weather
I'm drowning and there is no relief from
And everything I say are my own thoughts
Don't listen to my very dull brother
I'm drowning and there is no relief from
Kathy's kisses, they fall out of her mouth onto the floor
Collect dust and sweep them under the door
They fall out of her dusty mouth
She's just sending me more and more and more
Kathy's kisses
...
Don't fall
Don't fall
Alone in a room I've been in once before
Shapes in the hall, I barricade the door
I'm out on the edge, but I'm not defeated yet
I hear my name above everything else
Mark! Mark! Above everything else
Don't fall
Don't fall
Today's freak out, nothing's familiar
And nothing seems to fit into the scheme of things
Seeing faces where there shouldn't be faces
No one's really certain what tomorrow brings
Don't fall, my friend
Or this nightmare never ends
Hiding inside a room that's running red
The place to be exists only in your head
In the focus of fear within the creases of a dress, a female dress
How did I come to be drowning in this mess
Ah, fucking mess
Don't fall
Don't fall
Today's freak out, nothing's familiar
And nothing seems to fit into the scheme of things
Seeing faces where there shouldn't be faces
No one's really certain what tomorrow brings
Don't fall
Don't fall
Don't fall
I know your back's against the wall
But this roaring silence
Won't devour us all
Freak out, nothing's familiar
Some things rearrange, the scheme of things
(Don't fall)
Freak out, nothing's familiar
(When your back's against the wall)
Some things rearrange, the scheme of things
(Don't fall)
Freak out, nothing's familiar
(When your back's against the wall)
Some things rearrange, the scheme of things
(But this roaring silence)
Freak out, nothing's familiar
(Won't devour us all)
Some things rearrange, the scheme of things
(Mistakes don't know)
Don't fall
Don't know what happened but somebody lost their mind tonight
Not sure what happened but I don't think I got home tonight
There's blood on my shirt
A clap of thunder and I see my life go flashing by
The smell of sulfur and I weep as I embrace the sky
And somebody screamed
My chest is burning, I think someone set my soul alight
Don't know what happened but I don't think I got home tonight
I wonder why
I wonder why
Ah, there's madness here today
Ah, I think I'll go away
Where is my wife?
Where is my wife?
I'm draining away
I'm draining away
(Draining away)
Here today
I shake my head and shiver
They smile and they stab my back as they shake my hand
Send out an SOS plea
Come quickly, I'm marooned in Monkeyland
Is there anyone there
Who understands me?
Anyone at all
I'm idly staring at the sky
Did anybody hear me sigh?
A million stars are a moving sight
To all you out there hearing me tonight
It's just a trick of the light
Yeah, it's just a trick of the light
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?
Is there anyone there?
Do I dismiss this with a sigh?
Oh yes, you must from time to time
And let the answers pass me by
More questions set to bend the mind
Is my creator a God or a man?
Yes, yours too
Does someone somewhere care and understand?
It's just a trick of the light
Yeah, it's just a trick of the light
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Tell me how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?
For all the tricks of the light
Yeah, for all the tricks of the light out there tonight
Tonight
I have to know what is real
And what is illusion
Oh, how does it feel
Beyond this confusion?
Is there anyone there?
Life's an optical illusion
Like other optical illusions
Oh, beware
Oh, beware
There it goes again
One cold damp evening
The world stood still
I watched as I held my breath
A silhouette I thought I knew
Came through, someone spoke to me
Whispered in my ear
This fantasy's for you
Fantasies are in this year
My whole life flashed, before my eyes
I thought, what they say is true
I've shed my skin and my disguise
And cold on the naked eye
Emerged from my cocoon
And a half-remembered tune
Played softly in my head, he said
He turns smiling
And he said
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
I realise a miracle is due
I dedicate this melody to you
But is this the stuff dreams are made of?
If this is the stuff dreams are made of
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on air
No wonder I feel like I'm floating on...
Air
Everywhere
Oh, it feels like I'm everywhere
Like when you fail to make the connection
You know how vital it is
Oh, when something slips through your fingers
You know how precious it is
Oh, when you reach the point when you know
It's only your second skin
It's only your second skin
(Something's banging on my door)
Like when you fail to make the connection
You know how vital it is (Someone's banging on my door)
Oh, when something slips through your fingers
You know how precious it is (Something's banging on my door)
Oh, when you reach the point when you know
It's only your second skin (Someone's banging on my door)
(Something's banging on my door)
(Someone's banging on my door)
I'm gazing at faces staring blankly at me
Oh, I suppose it's just a sign of the times
They tell me tomorrow will never arrive
But I've seen it end a million times
I lost my direction while dodging the flack
Oh, give me a hint or something
If I could freeze time at the flick of the switch
I wouldn't hesitate, no
There must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys
Obnoxious actions, obnoxious results
Yes, teachers who refuse to be taught
Distorted pictures and dizzy, dizzy people
Rush by me at the speed of thought
They sit at the tables and throw us the scraps
For Christ's sake leave me something
Now they can erase you at the flick of a switch
Oh, there must be a way
Oh, there must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys
There must be something wrong, boys
They're dragging me down
Eden, there's no Eden
Anyway
They sit at the tables and throw us the scraps
For Christ's sake, leave us something
Now they can erase you at the flick of a switch
How long will it take
Oh, there must be something wrong, boys
Yeah, there must be something wrong, boys
There must be something wrong, boys
And they're dragging me down
And they're dragging me down
And they're dragging me down
You either swim or you drown
Must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
Feeling less than human
I surmise that I'm less than human
In God's eyes
Time, he's on my side, she said
Time, he's on my side, she said
He may be on your side, I said
But it makes no difference in the end
He's coming after you, my friend
I must have cried a thousand times
Must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
Feeling less than human
I surmise I'm less than human
In God's eyes
I must have died a thousand times
I must have died a thousand times
And I must have cried a thousand times
I must have cried a thousand times
Wao-oo-oo...
White as a cotton cloud
Silence, sea and sky
Innocent as the child
Always asking why
I can take you there
I can show you
I can take you there
I'll be there
Oh, gently catching you as you fall
Hearing you when you call
Smiling as we climb
Oh, smiling crocodilic
Certainly as the sun
Bakes a Sahara day
Ancient as the hills
Crumbling into clay
I can take you there
I can show you
I can take you there
I'll be there
Oh, gently catching you as you fall
Hearing you when you call
Smiling as we climb
Smiling as we climb
There's pleasure and pain
No loss, no gain
Pleasure and pain
Again and again
Pleasure and pain
I can take you there
I can show you
I can take you there
I'll be there...
As you fall
This madness, this laughter
Outward feelings I can't control
This madness, this laughter
Outward feelings I can't control
Those coloured lights are leading me
Is it you, is it me?
Oh, is it you, is it me?
Where are we? First and last
Bound together in our past
Much too cruel, much too fast
Much too quick to anger
I suppose years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose years ago
Traps lay bare in my face
Set to keep me in my place
Waved goodbye to the child
And life it seems it's colder
I suppose years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose years ago
(Yes, but what are you saying?)
Please leave my mind intact
(Yes, but what do you mean?)
As I slowly grow older
Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Where are we each and all?
Creatures run and creatures crawl
Spinning here on this ball
Creatures run and creatures crawl
I suppose, years ago, years ago
I might have known
I suppose, years ago, years ago
I might have known
As I slowly grow older
Out of tune boys, out of tune boys
Signposts to the sun
Single file boys, single file boys
Signposts to the sun
High as you can go, Lennon to Monroe
Clawed their way to the stars
High as you can go, Lennon to Monroe
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew
And I don't care who you are
Oh, sign the line and away you fly
Unexpectedly rejected
Safety for the few
Same excuses resurrected
None of them are true
High as you can go, Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
High as you can go, Grace Kelly to Garbo
Clawed their way to the stars
I think they knew
No, I don't care who you are
Just sign the line and away you fly
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can make the sound
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can go to ground
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can make the sound
Take a chance and join the dance
And you can go to ground
Oh, go to ground
And I don't care who you are
Oh, turn around and away you fly
And away you fly
And I don't care who you are
No, I don't care who you are
As she parts her greying hair
Voices on the stair
When she turns, there's something there
Like a nightmare from the past
To the sound of splintered glass
Dance the monsters in the mask
Man of steel
Man of steel
You just stood laughing in the rain
Have you killed her, someone said
As they drag you from your bed
Ah, kicking in your head
What kind of times are these
No one hears, no one sees
As they drive you to your knees
Man of steel
Man of steel
Just standing in the rain
You just stood laughing in the rain
What kind of times are these
As they drive you to your knees
What kind of times are these
As they drive you to your...
Knees
Dying on your knees
Dying in the rain
The rain
How can you laugh this one away?
Will you ever laugh this one away?
How can you laugh this one away?
Will you ever laugh this one away?
Too much and it makes me crazy
Not enough and it makes me lazy
Too much makes me lazy
Not enough and it makes me crazy
Time stops just for a moment
And then again it's only an instant
Time stops just for an instant
And then again it's only a moment
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
Clean
Know what I mean?
(Know what I mean?)
I wish that this feeling
Would go away
They're gonna get you sooner or later
These tigers made of paper
Don't pay now, you have to pay later
Confronting tigers made of paper
They always keep themselves clean
Yeah, they always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
They always keep themselves clean
Clean
I can't shake this feeling
I, I can't shake this feeling
No, I can't shake this feeling
Feeling
How do you feel?
Feel myself falling to the ground
Solitary silence, there's no sound
Open my eyes and look around
Colours and concepts that confound
All around
You wait till your time comes round again
Pick myself up and take the air
The fragrance of children everywhere
Slowly absorbed into my square
Debating what is and isn't there
Who cares
Just wait until your turn comes round
Again
Again
London calling to the faraway towns
Now war is declared, and battle come down
London calling to the underworld
Come out of the cupboard, you boys and girls
London calling, now don't look to us
Phoney Beatlemania has bitten the dust
London calling, see we ain't got no swing
Except for the ring of that truncheon thing
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Meltdown expected, the wheat is growing thin
Engines stop running, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river
London calling to the imitation zone
Forget it brother, you can go it alone
London calling to the zombies of death
Quit holding out, and draw another breath
London calling, and I don't wanna shout
But while we were talking, I saw you nodding out
London calling, see we ain't got no high
Except for that one with the yellowy eyes
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river
The ice age is coming, the sun's zooming in
Engines stop running, the wheat is growing thin
A nuclear error, but I have no fear
'Cause London is drowning, and I live by the river
Now get this...
London calling, yes, I was there too
And you know what they said? Well, some of it was true!
London calling at the top of the dial
And after all this, won't you give me a smile?
London calling...
I never felt so much alike alike alike alike...
Driiiiiiiive!!!
Driiiiiiiive!!!
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
Yes she did!
My baby drove up in a brand new Cadillac
She said, "Hey, come here, Daddy!"
"I ain't never comin' back!"
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
C'mon, sugar, just come on back to me
She said, "Balls to you, Big Daddy."
She ain't never coming back!
Baby, baby, won't you hear my plea?
Oh c'mon, just hear my plea
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy."
She ain't coming back to me
Baby, baby drove up in a Cadillac
I said, "Jesus Christ! Where'd you get that cadillac?"
She said, "Balls to you, Daddy."
She ain't never coming back!
The police walked in for Jimmy Jazz
I said, he ain't here, but he sure went past
Oh, you're looking for Jimmy Jazz
Sattamassagana for Jimmy Dread

Well, I got a friend who's a man
Who's a man? What man?
The man who keeps me from the lovely
He gives me what I need
What you need? What you got?
I need it all so badly
Oh, anything I want he gives it to me
Anything I want he gives it, but not for free
It's hateful
And it's paid for and I'm so grateful to be nowhere
This year I've lost some friends
Some friends? What friends?
I dunno, I ain't even noticed
You see, I gotta go out again
Again? My friend
I gotta see that mainman
I killed all my nerves
My nerves? What swerves?
And I can't drive so steady
And already
I've lost my memory
My mind? Behind!
I can't see so clearly
Sing, Michael, sing-on the route of the 19 Bus
Hear them sayin'
How you get a rude and a reckless?
Don't you be so crude and a feckless
You been drinking brew for breakfast
Rudie can't fail
So we reply
I know that my life make you nervous
But I tell you that I can't live in service
Like the doctor who was born for a purpose***
Rudie can't fail

'CAUSE WHAT I NEED I JUST DON'T HAVE
FIRST THEY CURSE, THEN THEY PRESS ME TILL I HURT
WE SAY RUDIE CAN'T FAIL

You need someone for a saviour
Oh, Rudie can't fail

We been drinking brew for breakfast
So Rudie can't fail
Okay!

Hey boss man!
You're looking pretty smart
In your chicken skin suit
You think you're pretty hot
In your pork pie hat
But...Rudie can't fail
Look out, look out...
Sky juice!...10 cents a bottle!
Spanish songs in Andalucia
The shooting sites in the days of '39
Oh, please, leave the ventana open
Fredrico Lorca is dead and gone
Bullet holes in the cemetery walls
The black cars of the Guardia Civil
Spanish bombs on the Costa Rica
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh mi corazon
Spanish bombs, yo te quiero infinito
yo te acuerda oh mi corazon
Spanish weeks in my disco casino
The freedom fighters died upon the hill
They sang the red flag
They wore the black one
But after they died it was Mockingbird Hill
Back home the buses went up in flashes
The Irish tomb was drenched in blood
Spanish bombs shatter the hotels
My senorita's rose was nipped in the bud
The hillsides ring with "Free the people"
Or can I hear the echo from the days of '39?
With trenches full of poets
The ragged army, fixin' bayonets to fight the other line
Spanish bombs rock the province
I'm hearing music from another time
Spanish bombs on the Costa Brava
I'm flying in on a DC 10 tonight
Spanish songs in Andalucia, Mandolina, oh mi corazon
Spanish songs in Granada, oh mi corazon
Say, where did I see this guy?
In Red River?
Or a place in the sun?
Maybe the Misfits?
Or From Here to Eternity?
Everybody say, "Is he all right?"
And everybody say, "What's he like?"
Everybody say, "He sure look funny."
That's...Montgomery Clift, honey!
New York, New York, New York, 42nd Street
Hustlers rustle and pimps pimp the beat
Monty Clift is recognized at dawn
He ain't got no shoes and his clothes are torn
I see a car smashed at night
Cut the applause and dim the light
Monty's face is broken on a wheel
Is he alive? Can he still feel?
Nembutol numbs it all
But I prefer alcohol
He said go out and get me my old movie stills
Go out and get me another roll of pills
There I go again shaking, but I ain't got the chills
ARRRGHHHGORRA BUH BHUH DO ARRRRGGGGHHHHNNNN!!!!
I'm all lost in the supermarket
I can no longer shop happily
I came in here for that special offer
A guaranteed personality
I wasn't born so much as I fell out
Nobody seemed to notice me
We had a hedge back home in the suburbs
Over which I never could see
I heard the people who lived on the ceiling
Scream and fight most scarily
Hearing that noise was my first ever feeling
That's how it's been all around me
I'm all tuned in, I see all the programmes
I save coupons from packets of tea
I've got my giant hit discoteque album
I empty a bottle and I feel a bit free
The kids in the halls and the pipes in the walls
Make me noises for company
Long distance callers make long distance calls
And the silence makes me lonely
And it's not here
It disappeared
I'm all lost
Hey, hey!
Ooh!
The kingdom is ransacked
the jewels all taken back
and the chopper descends
they're hidden in the back
with a message on a half-baked tape
with the spool going round
saying I'm back here in this place
and I could cry
and there's smoke you could click on
What are we gonna do now?
Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a Jew?
'Cause they're working for the clampdown
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!
When we're working for the clampdown
We will teach our twisted speech
To the young believers
We will train our blue-eyed men
To be young believers
The judge said five to ten, but I say double that again
I'm not working for the clampdown
No man born with a living soul
Can be working for the clampdown
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall
How can you refuse it?
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power
D'you know that you can use it?
The voices in your head are calling
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming
Only a fool would think someone could save you
The men at the factory are old and cunning
You don't owe nothing, so boy get running
It's the best years of your life they want to steal
You grow up and you calm down
You're working for the clampdown
You start wearing the blue and brown
You're working for the clampdown
So you got someone to boss around
It makes you feel big now
You drift until you brutalize
You made your first kill now
In these days of evil presidentes
Working for the clampdown
But lately one or two has fully paid their due
For working for the clampdown
Ha! Gitalong! Gitalong!
Working for the clampdown
Ha! Gitalong! Gitalong!
Working for the clampdown
Yeah I'm working hard in Harrisburg
Working hard in Petersburg
Working for the clampdown
Working for the clampdown
Ha! Gitalong! Gitalong
Begging to be melted down
Gitalong, gitalong
(Work)
(Work)
(Work) And I've given away no secrets - ha!
(Work)
(Work)
(More work)
(More work)
(Work)
(Work)
(Work)
(Work)
Who's barmy now?
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
When the law break in
How you gonna go?
Shot down on the pavement
Or waiting on death row
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
The money feels good
And your life you like it well
But surely your time will come
As in heaven, as in hell
You see, he feels like Ivan
Born under the Brixton sun
His game is called survivin'
At the end of the harder they come
You know it means no mercy
They caught him with a gun
No need for the Black Maria
Goodbye to the Brixton sun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton
When they kick at your front door
How you gonna come?
With your hands on your head
Or on the trigger of your gun
You can crush us
You can bruise us
Yes, even shoot us
But oh-the guns of Brixton
Shot down on the pavement
Waiting in death row
His game is called survivin'
As in heaven as in hell
You can crush us
You can bruise us
But you'll have to answer to
Oh, the guns of Brixton
Stagger Lee met Billy and they go down to gambling
Stagger Lee throwed seven
Billy said that he throwed eight
So Billy said, hey Stagger! I'm gonna make my big attack
I'm gonna have to leave my knife in your back
Why do you try to cheat?
And trample people under your feet
Don't you know it is wrong?
To cheat the trying man
So you better stop, it is the wrong 'em boyo
You lie, steal, cheat and deceit
In such a small, small game
Don't you know it is wrong
Billy Boy has been shot
And Stagger Lee's come out on top
Don't you know it is wrong
To cheat the trying man
To cheat Stagger man
You'd better stop
So you must start all over again-all over again
You got to play it, Billy, play, you got to play it, Billy, play
And you will find it is the right 'em boyo
But if you must lie and deceit
And trample people under your feet
Don't you know it is wrong
It is the wrong 'em boyo
Now every cheap hood strikes a bargain with the world
Ends up making payments on a sofa or a girl
Love 'n hate tattooed across the knuckles of his hands
Hands that slap his kids around, 'cause they don't understand how
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story
'N every gimmick hungry yob digging gold from rock 'n roll
Grabs the mic to tell us he'll die before he's sold
But I believe in this and it's been tested by research
He, who fucks nuns, will later join the church
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Fear in the gun-sights
They say lie low
You say ok
Don't wanna play the show
Now all you're thinking
"Was it death or glory now?"
Playing the blues of kings
Sure looks better now
Death or glory, just another story?
Death or glory, just another story?
From every dingy basement, on every dingy street
Every dragging handclap over every dragging beat
It's just the beat of time, the beat that must go on
If you've been trying for years, we 'ready heard your song
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, just another story?
We gonna march, a long way
Fight, a long time
We got to travel, over mountains
Got to travel, over seas
We gonna fight, your brother
We gonna fight, 'til you lose
We gonna raise, trouble
We gonna raise, hell
We gonna fight, your brother
Raise, hell
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Death or glory, just another story?
Death or glory, becomes just another story
Elevator! Going up!
In the gleaming corridors of the 51st floor
The money can be made if you really want some more
Executive decision-a clinical precision
Jumping from the windows-filled with indecision
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
It's the pause that refreshes in the corridors of power
When top men need a top up long before the happy hour
Your snakeskin suit and your alligator boot
You won't need a launderette, you can send them to the vet!
I get my advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
Koka Kola advertising and kokaine
Strolling down the Broadway in the rain
Neon light sign says it
I read it in the paper-they're crazy!
Suit your life, maybe so
In the White House-I know
All Over Berlin (they've been doing it for years)
And in Manhattan!
Coming through the door is a snub nose 44
What the barrel can't snort it can spatter on the floor
Your eyeballs feel like pinballs
And your tongue feels like a fish
You're leaping from the windows-saying don't
Ayaiiiiirrrghhh! *@!!*@!!*!
Don't give me none of this!
I get good advice from the advertising world
Treat me nice says the party girl
Koke adds life where there isn't any
So freeze, man, freeze
Hit the deck!
There's a solitary man crying, "Hold me."
It's only because he's a-lonely
If the keeper of time runs slowly
He won't be alive for long!
If he only had time to tell of all of the things he planned
With a card up his sleeve, what would he achieve?
It means nothing!
To the opium den and the barroom gin
In the Belmont chair playing violins
The gambler's face cracks into a grin
As he lays down the king of spades
But the dealer just stares
There's something wrong here, he thinks
The gambler is seized and forced to his knees
And shot dead
He only wanted more time
Away from the darkest door
But his luck it gave in
As the dawn light crept in
And he lay on the floor
From the Hundred Year War to the Crimea
With a lance and a musket and a Roman spear
To all of the men who have stood with no fear
In the service of the King
Before you met your fate be sure you
Did not forsake your lover
May not be around anymore
Yeh, you must treat your lover girl right
If you wanna make lover's rock
You must know a place you can kiss to make lovers rock
'Cause everybody knows it's a crying shame
But nobody knows the poor babie's name
When she forgot that thing that she had to swallow
You Western man, you're free with your seed
When you make lovers rock
But woops! there goes the strength that you need
To make real cool lovers rock
'Cause a genuine lover takes off his clothes
And he can make a lover in a thousand go's
An' she don't need that thing that she had to swallow
Well they were given the grapes that go ripe in the sun
That loosen the screws at the back of the tongue
But they told no one where they had begun-four horsemen
They were given all the foods of vanity
And all the instant promises of immortality
But they bit the dust screamin' insanity!-four horsemen
One was over the edge, one was over the cliff
One was lickin' em dry with a bloody great spliff
When they picked up the hiker he didn't want the lift
From the horsemen
But you!
You're not searching, are you now?
You're not looking anyhow
You're never gonna ride that lonely mile
Or put yourself up on trial
Oh, you told me how your life was so bad
An' I agree that it does seem sad
But that's the price that you gotta pay
If you're lazing all around all day
Four horsemen coming right through
Four horsemen and they're pissing by you
They make you look like you're wearing a truss
Four horsemen and it's gonna be us
Well they gave us everything for bending the mind
And we cleaned out their pockets and we drank 'em blind
It's a long way to the finish so don't get left behind
By those horsemen
And they gave us the grapes that went ripe in the sun
That loosen the scews at the back of the tongue
But we still told nothing 'bout what was to come
Four horsemen
If it's true that a rich man leads a sad life
N' that's what they from day to day
Then what do all the poor do with their lives?
On judgment day with nothing to say?
I've been beat up, I've been thrown
Out but I'm not down, I'm not down
I've been shown up, but I've grown up
And I'm not down, I'm not down
On my own I faced a gang of jeering in strange streets
When my nerves were pumping and I
Fought my fear in, I did not run
I was not done
And I have lived that kind of day
When one of your sorrows will go away
It goes down and down and hit the floor
Down and down and down some more
Depression
But I know there'll be some way
When I can swing everything back my way
Like skyscrapers rising up
Floor by floor, I'm not giving up
So you rock around and think that
You're the toughest
In the world, the whole wide world
But you're streets away from where
It gets the roughest
You ain't been there
I'm not down
Revolution rock, it is a brand new rock
A bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you move, Mac, you dig me in me back
An' I'm so pilled up that I rattle
I have got the sharpeest knife, so I cut the biggest slice
But I have no time to do battle
Everybody smash up your seats and rock to this
Brand new beat
This here music mash up the nation
This here music cause a sensation
Tell your ma, tell your pa everything's gonna be all right
Can't you feel it? DOn't ignore it
Gonna be Arl-right
Revolution rock, I am in a state of shock
So bad, bad rock, this here revolution rock
Careful how you slide, Clyde, all you did was glide
And you poured your beer in me hat
With my good eye on the beat, living on fixation strete
And I ai't got no time for that
Say you stand by your man
Tell me something I don't understand
You said you love me and that's a fact
Then you left me, said you felt trapped
Well some things you can explain away
But my heartache's in me till this day
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
All the times
When we were close
I'll remember these things the most
I see all my dreams come tumbling down
I won't be happy without you around
So all alone I keep the wolves at bay
There is only one thing that I can say
You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Now I got a job
But it don't pay
I need new clothes
I need somewhere to stay
But without all these things I can do
But without your love I won't make it through
But you don't understand my point of view
I suppose there's nothing I can do
You must explain why this must be
Did you lie when you spoke to me?
Did you stand by me
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
Did you stand by me
No, not at all
Did you stand by me
No way
I think it's dark and it looks like it's rain, you said
And the wind is blowing like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second
I think I'm old and I'm feeling pain, you said
And it's all running out like it's the end of the world, you said
And it's so cold, it's like the cold if you were dead
And then you smiled for a second
Sometimes you make me feel
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
Like I'm living at the edge of the world
It's just the way I smile, you said
I've been looking so long at these pictures of you
That I almost believe that they're real
I've been living so long with my pictures of you
That I almost believe that the pictures are
All I can feel
Remembering you
Standing quiet in the rain
As I ran to your heart to be near
And we kissed as the sky fell in
Holding you close
How I always held close in your fear
Remembering you
Running soft through the night
You were bigger and brighter and wider than snow
And screamed at the make-believe
Screamed at the sky
And you finally found all your courage
To let it all go
Remembering you
Fallen into my arms
Crying for the death of your heart
You were stone white
So delicate
Lost in the cold
You were always so lost in the dark
Remembering you
How you used to be
Slow drowned
You were angels
So much more than everything
Hold for the last time then slip away quietly
Open my eyes
But I never see anything
If only I'd thought of the right words
I could have held on to your heart
If only I'd thought of the right words
I wouldn't be breaking apart
All my pictures of you
Looking so long at these pictures of you
But I never hold on to your heart
Looking so long for the words to be true
But always just breaking apart
My pictures of you
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to feel you deep in my heart
There was nothing in the world
That I ever wanted more
Than to never feel the breaking apart
All my pictures of you
I'm running out of time
I'm out of step and closing down
And never sleep for wanting hours
The empty hours of greed and uselessly
Always the need to feel again
The real belief of something more than mockery
If only I could fill my heart with love
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am home again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am whole again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am young again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am fun again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
(Fly me to the moon)
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am free again
Whenever I'm alone with you
You make me feel like I am clean again
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
Whatever words I say
I will always love you
I will always love you
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Expectant, too punctual
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But older than me now
More constant, more real
And the fur and the mouth and the innocence turned
To hair and contentment
That hangs in abasement
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
The walking through walls
In the heart of December
The blindness of happiness
Of falling down laughing
And I really believed that this time was forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
All this in an instant
Before I can kiss you
A woman now standing
Where once there was only a girl
(Your name like ice into my heart)
I'm so glad you came
I'm so glad you remembered
To see how we're ending
Our last dance together
Reluctantly, cautiously
But prettier than ever
I really believe that this time it's forever
But Christmas falls late now
Flatter and colder
And never as bright
As when we used to fall
And even if we drink
I don't think we would kiss
In the way that we did
When the woman was only a girl
(I spy with my little eye)
(Something beginning with S)
On candy stripe legs the spiderman comes
Softly through the shadow of the evening sun
Stealing past the windows of the blissfully dead
Looking for the victim shivering in bed
Searching out fear in the gathering gloom and suddenly!
A movement in the corner of the room!
And there is nothing I can do
When I realize with fright
That the spiderman is having me for dinner tonight!
Quietly he laughs, shaking his head
Creeps closer now
Closer to the foot of the bed
And softer than shadow
And quicker than flies
His arms are all around me and his tongue in my eyes
"Be still be calm be quiet now my precious boy
Don't struggle like that or I will only love you more
For it's much too late to get away or turn on the light
The spiderman is having you for dinner tonight"
And I feel like I'm being eaten
By a thousand million shivering furry holes
And I know that in the morning
I will wake up in the shivering cold
And the spiderman is always hungry...
(Come into my parlour)
(Said the spider to the fly)
(I have a little something here)
Oh, it's opening time
Down on Fascination Street
So let's cut the conversation
And get out for a bit
Because I feel it all fading
And paling and I'm begging
To drag you down with me
To kick the last nail in
Yeah, I like you in that
Like I like you to scream
But if you open your mouth
Then I can't be responsible
For quite what goes in
Or to care what comes out
So just pull on your hair
Just pull on your pout
And let's move to the beat
Like we know that it's over
If you slip going under
Slip over my shoulder
So just pull on your face
Just pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time
Down on Fascination Street
So pull on your hair
Pull on your pout
Cut the conversation
Just open your mouth
Pull on your face
Pull on your feet
And let's hit opening time
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
Down on Fascination Street
On Fascination Street
You shatter me your grip on me a hold on me so dull it kills
You stifle me infectious sense of hopelessness and prayers for rain
I suffocate, I breathe in dirt and nowhere shines but desolate
And drab the hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me your hands on me a touch so plain so stale it kills
You strangle me entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
I deteriorate I live in dirt and nowhere glows but drearily and tired
And tired the hours all spent on killing time again all waiting for the rain
You fracture me your hands on me a touch so plain so stale it kills
You strangle me entangle me in hopelessness and prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
Prayers for rain
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
Can't you see I try
Swimming the same deep water as you is hard
The shallow drowned, lose less than we
You breathe the strangest twist upon your lips
And we shall be together
And we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, bow your head, and join with me
And face pushed deep, reflections meet
The strangest twist upon your lips
And disappear, the ripples clear
And laughing break against your feet
And laughing break the mirror sweet
So we shall be together
So we shall be together
Kiss me goodbye, pushing out before I sleep
It's lower now, and slower now
The strangest twist upon your lips
But I don't see, and I don't feel
But tightly hold up silently
My hands, before my fading eyes
And in my eyes your smile
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
The very last thing before I go
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
I will kiss you forever on nights like this
I will kiss you, I will kiss you
And we shall be together
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The shameless kiss of vanity
The soft and the black and the velvety
Up tight against the side of me
And mouth and eyes and heart all bleed
And run in thickening streams of greed
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
Oh, I miss the kiss of treachery
The aching kiss before I feed
The stench of a love for a younger meat
And the sound that it makes when it cuts in deep
The holding up on bended knees
The addiction of duplicities
As bit by bit it starts the need
To just let go my party piece
But I never said I would stay to the end
So I leave you with babies and hoping for frequency
Screaming like this in the hope of the secrecy
Screaming me over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the scenery
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the ending would be
So it's all come back round to breaking apart again
Breaking apart like I'm made up of glass again
Making it up behind my back again
Holding my breath for the fear of sleep again
Holding it up behind my head again
Cut in the deep to the heart of the bone again
Round and round and round and it's coming apart again
Over and over and over
And now that I know that I'm breaking to pieces
I'll pull out my heart and I'll feed it to anyone
I'm crying for sympathy, crocodiles cry
For the love of the crowd
And the three cheers from everyone
Dropping through sky
Through the glass of the roof
Through the roof of your mouth
Through the mouth of your eye
Through the eye of the needle
It's easier for me to get closer to Heaven
Than ever feel whole again
But I never said I would stay to the end
I knew I would leave you with babies and everything
Screaming like this in the hope of sincerity
Screaming it's over and over and over
I leave you with photographs, pictures of trickery
Stains on the carpet and stains on the memory
Songs about happiness murmured in dreams
When we both of us knew how the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
How the end always is
Always is
Always is
Hey hey!
Just one more and I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
And I forget how to move
When my mouth is this dry
And my eyes are bursting hearts
In a blood-stained sky
Oh it was sweet
It was wild
And oh how we...
I trembled
Stuck in honey
Honey
Cling to me
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Oh just one more
And I'll walk away
All the everything you win
Turns to nothing today
So just one more
Just one more go
Inspire in me the desire in me
To never go home
Hopelessly drift in the eyes of the ghost again
Down on my knees and my hands in the air again
Pushing my face in the memory of you again
But I never know if it's real
Never know how I wanted to feel
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Never quite said what I wanted to say to you
Never quite managed the words to explain to you
Never quite knew how to make them believable
And now the time has gone
Another time undone
Hopelessly fighting the devil futility
Feeling the monster climb deeper inside of me
Feeling him gnawing my heart away hungrily
I'll never lose this pain
Never dream of you again
Be a man can a mystery man
Be a doll be a baby doll
It can't be fun not anyway
It can't be found no way at all
A distant man can't sympathise
He can't uphold his distant laws
Due to form on that today
I got a feeling then I hear this call
I said Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat Neat Neat
No crime if there ain't no law
No more cops left to mess you around
No more dreams of mystery chords
No more sight to bring you down
I got a crazy got a thought in my mind
My mind's on when she falls asleep
Feelin' fine in her restless time
Then these words upon me creep
I said Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat Neat Neat
Be a man can a mystery man
Be a doll like a baby doll
It can't be fun not anyway
It can't be found no way at all
A distant man can't sympathise
Can't uphold his distant laws
Due to form on that today
I got a feeling then I hear that call
I said Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a gun at all
Neat Neat Neat
She can't afford a cannon
Neat Neat Neat
She ain't got no name to call
Neat Neat Neat
Well I'm craving for a cigarette
Hey give me a light
Feeling kind of thirsty
Give me something that bites
Sure been hanging 'round here
For much too long
All you crazy people waiting for my song
I said
Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
Waiting for an autograph
Well you must be mad
Standing in the pissing rain
Must be a drag
If that's what you wanna do
I won't say no
If you wanna see more of me
See me after the show
I said
Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
Well you send me pretty flowers
While I'm slashing my wrists
Read those little letters
Through my smashed out mists
The dream I shock you
Is my nightmare
I'm the freak that's on display
So stand and stare
I said
Well here I am
I'm just another one night stand
Anyway I don't know why I'm sad
For my fan club
I gotta full moon
A smaller room than I need
A candy store a sexy whore
Yes I bleed
A sifting sand and an electronic hand
Yes I'm fine
I've got a pissed of god a government shock
Yes I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
My mind's a raging blame
A crying shame and I'm sad
A city of sin a bottle of gin
So dog-gone bad
A cool reaction for the big attraction
That's fine
A pissed off god a government shock
Well I'm blind
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
I'm a falling angel
Falling down
Be a falling angel
Won't you come around?
Don't be scared to follow
It's no crime
You're a falling angel
Before your time
And I fall
Well I fall
Well I fall
Yeah I fall
I get a calling time of day
Beat a lot a lot of crime away
There's nothing baby I can't take
With that crime I'm gonna make your body ache
It's no kind of big deal
No carnegie steal
I don't feel like no heel
When I'm born
Said I'm born
Yeah I'm born
And I'm born to kill
Said I'm born
Yeah I'm born
Know I'm born
When I'm born to kill
Jet along and jive my back

No carnegie steal

Born to kill
Born to kill
Born to kill

I know you're cold but I've seen it before
I'll take a chance on the wine
Your starched white lips intravenous she drips
In fear of turning blind
Hair to grey and some guys say
Shows you're shows you're growing old
Do it again I can't explain
The light sure seems cold
Feel the pain it leaves no stain
Feel the pain the name of the game
Drop some blues time to choose
Why your heart is just a stabbing
Bloody eyes can't describe
The nature of your hacking
Back to front the blade tastes blunt
In the safety of your bedroom
No desire to touch the fire
It's just a just a sad obsession
Feel the pain
It leaves no stain (leaves no stain)
Feel the pain
The name of the game
Feel the pain
It leaves no stain (leaves no stain)
Feel the pain
The name of the game Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Feel the pain
Is she really going out with him?
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why I don't know why
I guess these things have got to be
I gotta new rose I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
See the sun see the sun it shines
Don't get too close or it'll burn your eyes
Don't you run away that way
You can come back another day
I got a new rose I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
I never thought this could happen to me
This is strange why should it be
I don't deserve somebody this great
I'd better go or it'll be too late
I got a feeling inside of me
It's kind of strange like a stormy sea
I don't know why I don't know why
I guess these things have got to be
I got a new rose I got her good
Guess I knew that I always would
I can't stop to mess around
I got a brand new rose in town
Well I've seen you hanging round and round
On the streets with something that's on your mind
Don't you think that I'd be impressed?
Only want to lay with you

Oh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
You want me to hang around
With you always
But you lie and die when
All you ever give me is disgrace
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two
One of the two
With our saturation eyes
You think you can disguise all those mean things
But can you grovel in the dust
Masochistic lust make the song sing
Oh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two

Oh yeah you're all cracked up fury
Won't get the jury to defend you
You tried but you couldn't cry
When they see you
You want me to hang around
With you always
But you lie and die well
All you ever give me is disgrace
That's the way down
That's the way down
That's sedation
That's sedation
One of the two
One of the two
One of the two
One of the two
One of the two
One, two, three oh she's so
Messed up she don't even ball
Well she's so messed up she has no fun at all
She's a sad case of hit and run
I think that I would rather fuck her mum
Oh yeah her face is such a mess
The best thing she can do is die
Oh well I'd save her the trouble
But I bet you'd still call it a crime
Oh would you now
So messed up well she's so messed up
Oh yeah she's so messed up so messed up
So messed up
So messed up

So messed up
Lying in the gutter
So messed up
Flat on her face

Out of England, I dream of its creamery
When I'm there I dwell on Saxony
In Turkey when I've been due to World War I
Istanbul is the place cause of my birthday
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
I got everything
I got everything I want except for hungry
I got everything I want except for money
I've got the best round set aside for parties
They'll have one when I've gone, In fact, they said so, good one
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
Friends disintegrate within circles of cash
Residue after years of fab genius
Is a pension for the Jews and a medal from the company
Which I wiped my butt on and hung on a laburnum tree
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
I am barmy
Bleedin' barmy
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
Just call me the first
I lay waiting hopefully on sloped grass green
I am barmy, bleedin' barmy

Past trees the fairies are flyin
Past trees with rose bushes in
The child was spoilt Victorian

Spoilt victorian child

Sugar and cakes appear mean
Sitting at the table
Tigers pop-up from books
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child

Let's take it ten years on
You're looking back from then
Under rough grey blankets
Thread loose stained grey blanket
Spoilt victorian child
Spoilt victorian child

Thru' the aqueduct of five years
Spoilt victorian child shall avoid reflection

Mirrors can't hide the toxic of disfigured poxes

The butterfly shrugs to fly in
Sugar and iced cakes appear mean

And as you walk in on the footsteps steed babe
In the encrusted green unwild
You know you are a spoilt victorian child

I'm telling you now and I'm telling you this
Life can be an onward, downward
Chip-chit-chip-chit-chip
I'm not saying they're really thick
But all the groups who've hit it big
Make the Kane Gang look like
An Einstein chip
Chip
NYC
Chip
A place to live
Chip
This is the Thule group
This is the cool group
I'm telling you now and I'm telling you this
Shawn and Petula, macabre
Here are your wedding pictures
They are black
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud
Boffins bray
Boffins brag
Stick it in the gut
Stick in the mud
They take from the medium poor to
Give to the needy poor
Via the government poor
Give it to the poor poor
They're knocking on my door
Entrance
Entranced
Stick it in the mud
Stick it in the gut
Cheap fog
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt
Stick it in the gut
Who are the riff-makers
Who are they really?
How old are the stars really?
Half-wit philanthropist, cosy charity gig
If God could see this
He'd stick it
They stick it in the gut
Cheap fog
Rotting scout-belt
Stick it in the gut
Stay in the mud
They take it from the medium poor
To give it to the medium poor
Via the government poor
And give it to the poor poor
Stick it in the gut
Red composite
Wealthy philanthropist
You son of a bitch
Entranced

I'm telling you now
And I'm telling you this
Life can be a downward chip
My new house
You should see my house
My new house
You should see my new house
No rabbit hutch about it
I bought it off the baptists
I get the bills
And I get miffed
At the damn polyester fills
The interior is a prison unconscious
My new house
Keep away from my new house
Wash the drawers of pills
It's got window sills
With lead centred in the middle of them
My new house
Is no beatnik hang-out
That Halifax copter
Sure dropped me a cropper
Sometimes I think I'll ring Swine-Tax
And go back to my flat
But my new house
I do love the mad things about it
According to the postman
It's like the bleeding Bank of England
Creosote tar fence surrounds it
Those razor blades eject when I press eject
My new house
Could easily crack a mortal, it
The spare room is fine
Though a little haunted
By Mr. Reagan who had hung himself at number 13
Mr. Reagan hung himself at number 13
It'll be great when it's decorated
My new house
We go two, twice all the way round those things
Two high ones, two low ones, yeah
Right man
Man stopped us at corner
He had a bloody nose
And then he opened his denim jacket
It was under his vest made out of tracing paper
Chest scars portrayed Aztec life in his horrible
Formation really late
Main sequence stars were no good for making carbon in this way
Red giant stars
Disfigured in a lady, tedious
Was over accountant's and on business
Then I woke up and I decided to recommence my diary
Then I read Paula Yates on vision mopeds
Then I found out we were not going to Italy
Later Mam said 'Those continentals are little monkeys'
And yesterday we had liver and sausage over
And sometimes they say 'Hey Mark you're spoiling all the paintwork'
And sometimes they say 'Your thumbprints are on the paintwork'
Distractors, post-doctors behind come in
Dressed in suits, grow talons
Everyone clenched plaits horror
And sometimes they say...
And sometimes I feel like saying
This is bloody Newark
Or some drive-in slap place
In Breda and in Cologne
With the shirt on/off
Sun in vicinity
As if I hadn't done 10 month's service
In the USA
On media guts
It circles is where I start
And sometimes they say...
And I think
If I'd wanted to live in Holland
And if I'd wanted to be lived in
I'd have packed up and pissed off
When I was 16
A Swiss good ass/as/at this lousy business
Was the last thing I was ever imagining
Hey Mark, why can't I live in England?
The end of shoes, all warehouse shoe/you've got
Cheap new one, the target is too yahoo
And take over all the desparate
I'll take over discussion and
....humanely regular colours over...
...engineered oxidate zeppelin
Old world style, old man only juke box caught
All power jets on....spectacular facets
And sometimes they say....
Hey, you're fucking up the paintwork
What is this thing they're so hard-assed about?
I thought I lived in England
Generous, valeric, Jehovah's Witness
Stands in Cologne Marktplatz
Drums come in
When the drums come in fast
Drums to shock, into brass evil
What have you got in that paper bag?
Is it a dose of Vitamin C?
Ain't got no time for Western medicine
I am Damo Suzuki
The fuck-up like red acid rain
Give it to me Jaki every day
Who is Mr. Karlheinz Stockhausen?
Introduce me
I'm Damo Suzuki
Soundtracks, Soundtracks
Melched together, the lights
The lights above you
Listener was in cahoots with Fritz Lieber
And read him every day
Recipe for fear gas, amount of salt ash
I put by (cup of) meine fire, okay
I have no time for Western medicine
I am Damo Suzuki
May we go back to days pre-Virgin
Cannot get on clear vinyl
The handle that was brass, is now brass evil
The rock that was an egg, is in wrong cradle
The hand that cradles the rock, makes egg gooey
I am Damo Suzuki
Is this west latent pattern?
Run it, says Damo's spirit
Is this lesser European?
Speak it, says Damo's spirit
I am Damo Suzuki

There's a kid I know but not too well
He doesn't have a lot to say
Well, this boy lives right next door and he
Has nothing to say
It doesn't seem like he does anything
He never helps out in the yard
He lets his mother carry in groceries
'Cause he doesn't plan to work too hard
The boy next door is into better things
As far as I can see
The boy next door is into bigger things
The boy next door is me, all right
Well, he's not like the boys we used to have
Not like them at all - oh no
Those ones made their parents proud
This one beats 'em all
The boy next door is into better things
As far as I can see
The boy next door is into bigger things
The boy next door is me, yeah

You made your offer
A little too soon
It's not the first time it's happened
In a moment you said
You don't want to know me
It's seems as though that's never done
What I'm seeing as hopeless
You're seeing as won
The story asking
Could we be together tonight
I was raised by a different standard
And it wouldn't seem right
Ah...
It doesn't seem important
I'd like to know what matters then
As it happened they already did
I don't remember it
(Loveless love) Is not my plan
(Loveless love) Said it isn't romance
(Loveless love) You think it's cool I think it stinks
(Loveless love) You don't care what I think
Well, nobody's perfect
It's not the way you were raised to be-have
Try to understand
That's not the way to be
The tinge of the mind
The mind is in check
The check is the force
The forces at work
You said no commitment
When I asked you for a compromise
Just a compromise
Now I don't know why I ask you
It's always such a problem
Why make it a problem
You must be waiting for things to happen
Expecting something to happen
But nothing ever happens
Your voice raised in anger
Who knows what you're after
You don't know what you're after
You never seem to notice
The distance between us
The distance
You're only waiting for things to happen
Expecting something to happen
But nothing ever happens
Your weakness is getting stronger
With your disregard for conventions
I'm not looking for some
New kind of social age anyway
They all seem the same
Your inside is out
Your outside is in
Your outside is in
Your inside is out
So come on
Come on is such a joy
Come on is such a joy
Come on and take it easy
Come on and make it easy
Make it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
The higher you fly
The deeper you go
The deeper you go
The higher you fly
So come on
Come on
Come on it's such a joy
Come on it's such a joy
Come on, let's take it easy
Come on and make it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
Your inside is out
Your outside is in
Your outside is in
Your inside is out
So come on
Come on
Come on it's such a joy
Come on it's such a joy
Come on, let's make it easy
Come on and make it easy
Take it easy
Everybody's got something to hide
Except for me and my monkey
Come on
Come on
Come on
All you really wanted
Was to be alone at least a little while
How was I to know that
Well it seemed like an eternity
When you smile and say
"I thought about it, it's the right time"
And I expect that
You're never returning to the USA
All the way the lights are
I can see your face is getting clearer
It's like you never even left here
It's like you never had the reason
To want to go
Well I don't know
I think it's time for you to face it
You never felt right in our world
You never felt right about yourself
And I think about what it might be like
If I could go alone, if I could go at night
Would it be just like you know you said it would
Would it start the life of O
He said oh
He said oh
He said oh
Some will make it and some won't make it oh-oh
Oh the glory glory and the glory glory oh-oh
Said it's time to go, well alright
I don't wanna go, I say alright
You never listen to me anyway
You're always talking, never much to say
You remind me of a TV show
That's alright, I watch it anyway
I don't talk much cause it gets in the way
Don't let it get in the way
We'll do our job, we'll get things done
Work real hard and get things done
It's time to sail but not now
Can't relax when there's things to do
Big plans stay while the little ones fade
It's nice to know when it's part of your life
I don't want much and I need even less
It's time to sacrifice
Crazy rhythms
Crazy rhythms
Crazy rhythms
Said it's time to go, well alright
I don't wanna go, I say alright
You never listen to me anyway
You're always talking, never much to say
You remind me of a TV show
That's alright, I watch it anyway
I don't talk much cause it gets in the way
Don't let it get in the way
Crazy rhythms
Crazy rhythms
Crazy rhythms
Crazy rhythms
Johnny's got a light in his eyes and
Shirley's got a light on her lips
Jakes got a monkeyshine on his head
And Debra Ann's got a tiger in her hips
They can twist and turn, they can move and burn
They can throw themselves against the wall
But they creep for what they need
And they explode to the call
And then they move, move
Sex beat, go
They're stupid like I told ya, very stupid like ya saw
Very stupid as the simple thought of ever thinking at all
And all their mind, all their souls, all their bodies, all we know
All the things that should have made us whole
All the colourless security was all that someone could go
And move, move
Sex beat, drop
And yes, you do look cool, and by the floodlights so blue
You make my tropical apartment's bed your sacrificial pool
My body in the water, and my heart is in your hand
So this is the way you choose to send me
To the judgement land
So you can't move, move oohh
Sex beat, go
And every day I agree
You throw me down by the christmas tree
I watched your lights blink on and off while you
Start your fun with me
I, I know your reasons, and I, I know your goals
We can fuck forever, but you will never get my soul
Just so you can move
So you can move
So you can move
So you can move so you can
Sex beat
I was up this morning, blues walking like a man
I was up this morning, blues walking like a man
Worried blues, give me your right hand
And the blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Blues fell mama's child, tore me all upside down
Travel on ol' Jeffrey Lee, ya know, can't seem to turn him around
So, Preach the Blues
Preach the Blues now
Blues, is low down shaking chill
Blues, is low down shaking chill
You ain't never had them, I don't believe you will
Blues is an achin' old heart disease
Blues is an achin' old heart disease
It's like consumption, baby, killing me by degrees
So, Preach the Blues
Preach the Blues now
I had religion, Lord on this very day
I had religion, Lord on this very day
But, the women and the whiskey, they would not let me pray
Gonna get me religion, gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna get me religion, gonna join the Baptist church
Gonna be a Baptist preacher, so I don't have to work
Promise me
I'm silent in the trees, waiting tonight
Promise me
While the searching light moon has found me
You know it feels like the very last time again
Promise me
Someone who will promise me, stand in the dark and fight like me
Through eyes like fireflies
Turn around and tell me, it'll be alright
Is it alright?
Promise me
Don't cheat my soul when it returns to me
Promise me
Give me the vision I was born to see
You know it feels like years since they burned me away
You know it feels like years since they burned my heart away
You know it feels like years, feels like years
You know it feels like years since they took my eyes away
I cannot get a look at it
So, I'm burning them on the deal anyway
I see her come down from the top of the stairs
I guess that I'd be cool, but there's a tickle in my veins
I've been a real good tombstone, but now I'm blowing away
She is like an I.V. swimming pool
But she will never know that she is there
We sit together drunk like our fathers used to be
I'm looking up at God and saying, "What are you gonna do?"
I'm looking up and I'm crying because I thought it was up to you
She's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She cannot miss a vein
Don't let her take her love to town
They will never fill her heart
She needs a passion like her father's used to be
I know because I'm like the train shooting down the mainline
I know because I'm the Indian wind along the telegraph lines
And she's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She cannot miss a vein
So mainline it!
I cannot get a look at it
So I'm blowing back trouble to the east
While we sit together sad like our fathers used to be
I know a perfect run by the sleep it puts in my heart
I know my special rider, I can feel her in the dark
And she's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She feels like heroin to me
She cannot miss a vein
She's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She's like heroin to me
She cannot miss a vein
You look just like an Elvis from HELL
My heart is broken, so I'm going to HELL
Bury me way down deep in HELL
I'm a steel drivin' man, I want to go to HELL!
Then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
For the love of Ivy yeah-yeah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!
You're the one
Gonna buy me a graveyard of my own
Kill everyone who ever done me wrong
Gonna buy me a gun just as long as my arm
Kill everyone who ever done me harm
Then go tell Ivy oh-oh!
For the love of Ivy yeah-heah!
I did it for Ivy oh-oh!
You're the one
Well, jawbone eat and jawbone talk
Jawbone eat you with a knife and fork
I was hunting for niggers down in the dark
When all of a sudden I had a better thought
Let's go hunt Ivy, oh-oh!
Let's go get Ivy, Yeah-yeah!
For the love of Ivy, oh-oh!
You're the one
I did it for Ivy
I did it for Ivy
HA HA HA! Ivy!
I was all dressed up like Elvis from HELL! HELL!
I can see clearly
From my diamond eyes
I'm going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
No-one will accept all of me
So the Fire...will stop
Up through the streets
The gunfire of cars
Going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
No-one will take all of me
So the Fire...will stop
I will be cheating
The whole ritual
I'm going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
No-one will expect all of me
So the Fire..will stop
Someone will break out of the circle
Someone will turn and burn a world
Someone knows a better cell
Where the old north wind blows through southeast hell, yeah....
Invention was betrayed by the machine
Promised like it was promised to me
I'm going up to the mountain to see
How the last thing, will set me free, yeah...
I had to do something, I was wearing down
I was going down....
Why can no one ever touch a Fire Spirit?
Why can no one ever hold a Fire Spirit?
Why can no one ever feel a Fire Spirit?
I am going to the mountain
I am going to the mountain
I am going to the mountain....
I can see clearly
From my diamond eyes
I'm going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
No one will accept all of me...
And the fire...will stop...
With too much patience
And too much pain
Going to the mountain with the Fire Spirit
To make amends for all of me...
And the Fire...will stop
It's cloudy in the west, it looks like rain
My eyes are black holes and i'm burning away
You slaughtered your loving man
Killed him in his sleep
The blood and crying of your murder
Simply stains your sheets
Now, you're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost to the living men
Trailing souls to the end
You thought winning as a woman, meant failing as a friend
It is nor an art statement, to drown a few passionate men
You made yourself a diamond
To blind young men's eyes
You claim because they want your shine
They deserve to walk the line
You're a ghost on the highway
Your gesture is meaningless
You're lost forever to the living men
Trailing souls to the end
Yes, I would give you my love
So my soul would not starve
But, it could never move the honest rock
Of what you really are
You're a ghost on the highway
You're like straw and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
I'll carry that to the end
If I ever lie with you again, I pray I do not sleep
If I ever closed my eyes again, I'd realize what you are to me
You are simply a liar
An animal who bluffs and steals
Until you become
A bigger creature's meal
You're a ghost on the highway
Your trash and meaningless
I hate you, but I love you
I'll carry that to the end
You lost on the highway
I am like Jack, I am from southern land
I'm holding your happiness in my hand
The sun behind me is a sexual red
And all your bounty-hunting ghosts are dead
I am like Jack and I tell you this
I will be your lover and exorcist
In the stillness of the mosquito sunset
You will make love to me to your very best
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
Way back in the Indian days
Nothing could drive the heat away
Drive the search and murder of lost enemies
Drive deep into what is never seen
And like Jack, there is a heat to the fight
Like a moth detects a heat to the light
And like Jack, I covet everything that is you
Because, the heat in you will temporarily do
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
In New Orleans at the Mardi Gras
I was dancing in a costume made of straw
Some Creole boy was a-lying dead
I used his blood to paint my costume red
A-black and white, I will abandon brain
For your nerves in hand and a ball of string
The marshes are sinking in a bright red sky
And you will make love to me tonight
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
And when you fall in love with me
We can dig a hole by the willow tree
Then, I will fuck you until you die
Bury you and kiss this town goodbye
It will be unhappy, it will be sad
But, it will be understood that I am BAD!
So don't you go and lie to me
'Cause everyday is judgement day with me
Hey, hey, I'm like Jack On Fire
Hey, hey, your lips kiss Jack on Fire
You sleep with Jack On Fire
You eat me Jack On Fire
You think like Jack On Fire
Oh no, you are nothing
Oh no, you are a-nothing
You will eat like a Jack On Fire
You will dream like a Jack On Fire
You will think like a Jack On Fire
You will feel like a Jack On Fire
Oh no, you drive so deep
Drive so deep...
I'm moving on the black train
The night it beats me down
I'm moving on the Black Train
I breath a soundles sound
Riding on the Black Train
Every drop in my body moves with the train
And some of it's on the floor
I'm slippin' out to anyplace
Although I know I've been there before
Riding on the Black Train
Torn up on the Black Train
Torn from my southern home
Left a nigga lying dead by the river
Left the Will-O-the-Wisp to roam
Riding on the Black Train
I'm heat on the Black Train
A torch lighting up the night
With everything I've had and everything I've done
I still can't be satisfied
Riding on the Black Train
I ask for water, and she gave me gasoline
I ask for water, give me gasoline
I ask for water and she gave me gasoline
Lord, Lordy Lord
Cryin', Lord, I wonder, will I ever get back home?
Cryin', Lord, I wonder, I ever get back home?
Lord, Lordy Lord
I went to the depot, looked up on the board
I asked the conductor how long has this Eastbound train been gone?
I asked the conductor could I ride the blinds?
Son, buy your ticket, for that train ain't none of mine
Son, buy your ticket, train ain't none of mine
Lord, Lordy Lord
Look what's been done, John
It's coming out of the east like rain, Johnny
Look what's been done, John
It's coming like a God with no name, Johnny
And I'm out near Santa Fe
Hitching out for the warmer days
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down
Look down the line, Johnny
There's flashlights on the back-roads, Johnny
Look down the line, Johnny
Of the American unknown, Johnny
And I'm out here in the desert
All your dreams lie dead in the desert
I'm all torn up, Johnny
It all just beat me down, beat me down
Look at that girl, Johnny
Yellow hair a shine, Indian eyes to see, Johnny
Look at her, Johnny
Her love is like anything to me, Johnny
What slipped so deep into me?
I can never get it out of me
I'm all broke up, Johnny
It all just tore me down
Static, static, static
We're on a video rage
Static, static, static
We're on a video rage
We're all blue from projection tubes
We're all blue from projection tubes
This is the static age we live in
Our eyes criss-cross, hold and gaze
This is the static age we live in
Breathe in
Catch your radiation blue disease and turning, tossing
This is a static age
Our very static age
This is a static age
Static, static, static
We're on a video rage
Static, static, static
We're on a video rage
And we're all blue from projection tubes
We're all blue from projection tubes
There are paint smears on everything I own
The vapor rub is lying on a table of filth
Christmas cards to which I never reply
My eyeballs absorb only blue filtered light
TV casualty, TV casualty
We're all right
TV casualty, TV casualty
I wish they'd put Prince Namor on the tube
Hold on, I think I have to puke
There's a spot in the corner where I always go
I like to feed the flies that I know
But please don't feed my television screen
Please don't feed my television screen
Please don't feed my television screen
Please don't feed my television screen
TV casualty, TV casualty
We're all right
TV casualty, TV casualty
Babies in prison, they call it a womb
Nine month sentence, no parole
Slivers of steel stuck in your lungs
Breathe deep, we need a donor for blood
Jaguars at the cemetery
Cadillacs grazing at your grave
Zeniths grazing at your grave
Sonys grazing at your grave
TV casualty, TV casualty
We're all right
TV casualty, TV casualty
We're all right
TV casualty, TV casualty

And it doesn't matter much to me as long as it's dead
Well, I got somethin' to say, I raped your mother today
And it doesn't matter much to me as long as she's spread
Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Go!
Sweet lovely death, I am waitin' for your breath
Come, sweet death, one last caress
Well, I got somethin' to say, I killed your baby today

If you're gonna scream, scream with me
Moments like this never last
When new creatures rape your face
Hybrids opened up the door
Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars
In hybrid moments, give me a moment
Give me a moment, give me a moment
Ooh, baby, when you cry your face is momentary
You hide your looks behind these scars
In hybrid moments, in hybrid moments

We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138
In the eyes of the cyborg
Do you think we're robot clean
Does this face look almost mean
Is it time to be an android, not a man
The pleasantries are gone
We're stripped of all we were
In the eyes of cyborg
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138
We are 138, We are 138, We are 138

We land in barren fields
On the Arizona plains
The insemination of little girls
In the middle of wet dreams
We are the angel mutants
The streets for us seduction
Our cause unjust and ancient
In this "B" film born invasion
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care
Well, we've seen your 3D movies
In violent abduction
We blast your mindless structure
Inferior connection
We take your weak resistance
Throw it in your face
We need no introduction
For mass annihilation
Teenagers from Mars and we don't care

Did you like the fun?
Did you like the times that I promised you?
Open wounds on your brow
Little angel in red
She isn't loving you anymore
Little angelfuck
I seen you going down on a fireplug
Oh, little angelfuck
Sighs for everyone

Dry your eyes and we'll leave

Dry your eyes and we'll leave

President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedy's shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Johnny's wife is floundering
Johnny's wife is scared
Run, Jackie, run
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck
President's bullet ridden body in the street
Ride, Johnny, ride
Kennedys shattered head hits concrete
Ride, Johnny, ride
Texas is an outrage when your husband is dead
Texas is an outrage when they pick up his head
Texas is the reason that the president's dead
You gotta suck, suck, Jackie, suck
A-ride Jackie-O
Jonathan F. Kennedy will rise and be shot down
Dirt's gonna be your desert
My cum will be your life source
And the only way to get it
Is to suck
Or fuck
Or be poor and devoid, and masturbate me
Masturbate me, then slurp it from your palms
Like a dry desert soakin' up the rain, soakin' up the sun
Like a dry desert soakin' up the rain, soakin' up the sun
Drive drunk on a corner
Wet waste of a girl
Theme for a jackal
They play you your death song
You'd probably listen
Stand idly by as they rape your children
Like you do now
In fact, you showed them how
All thoughts are in place
All deeds are tended
Play, theme for a jackal, play
Die, sweet prince
Meat tastes like mince
The jackal's eaten enough for today
Die, sweet prince
Meat tastes like shit
Enough to make that jackal spit
Spit, jackal, spit
Spit and choke on the lives you've taken
You can't shake 'em loose
All morsels gone, they're too small
Acceptable from a source so tall
Her little sister on the front lawn
Bitch, bitch, she is
Cut her from the inside out
Your dead daughter in the river
Entrance gained by her liver
Play, theme for a jackal, play
They play you your death song
You'd probably listen
Stand idly by as he rapes your children
Like you do now
In fact, you showed him how
Play, theme for a jackal, play
Play, theme for a jackal, play
She walked out with empty arms
Machine gun in her hand
She is good and she is bad
No one understands
She walked in silence
Never spoke a word
She's got a rich daddy
She's her daddy's girl
She loves naked sin
He loves evil stares
She has lost control
They are growing old
She will hide in silence
Then her day will come
She was virgin vixen
She is on the run
She is on the run
She is on the run
This isn't really sex, this isn't really life
This isn't really anything I think I like
And I will not sit on broken glass
Not for you or anyone
I will not cut my ass
We have no reasons but we still have fun
Down on the floor, baby, whisper my name
Yeah, when you rip my back to shreds
I dig my boots into the soft remains of your spine
I want to savage your spinal remains
I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
In chains
This isn't really sex, this isn't really life
This isn't really anything I think I like
And I will not sit on broken glass
Not for you or anyone
I will not cut my fucking ass
I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
I want to savage, baby, your spinal remains
They're making you change
The light in the doorway
Shining so bright
In the doorway
I clench your hips for the flesh
You tore my prose
In the doorway
Animal lie
Like the doorway
As you hide
Hear it then
Will you let me in?
Let me in
Oh!
In the doorway
We were so young
In the doorway
Release the black dogs on our breasts
We'll never rest
We'll never rest
We'll never forget
I ain't never gonna let you rest
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
One two three four five six!
Roadrunner, roadrunner
Going faster miles an hour
Gonna drive past the Stop 'n' Shop
With the radio on
I'm in love with Massachusetts
And the neon when it's cold outside
And the highway when it's late at night
Got the radio on
I'm like the roadrunner
Alright
I'm in love with modern moonlight
128 when it's dark outside
I'm in love with Massachusetts
I'm in love with the radio on
It helps me from being alone late at night
It helps me from being lonely late at night
I don't feel so bad now in the car
Don't feel so alone, got the radio on
Like the roadrunner
That's right
Said welcome to the spirit of 1956
Patient in the bushes next to '57
The highway is your girlfriend as you go by quick
Suburban trees, suburban speed
And it smells like heaven (thunder)
And I say roadrunner once
Roadrunner twice
I'm in love with rock & roll and I'll be out all night
Roadrunner
That's right
Well now
Roadrunner, roadrunner
Going faster miles an hour
Gonna drive to the Stop 'n' Shop
With the radio on at night
And me in love with modern moonlight
Me in love with modern rock & roll
Modern girls and modern rock & roll
Don't feel so alone, got the radio on
Like the roadrunner
O.K., now you sing Modern Lovers

Alright
Right, bye bye!
Tonight I'm all alone in my room
I'll go insane if you won't sleep with me
I'll still be with you
I'm gonna meet you on the astral plane
The astral plane for dark at night
The astral plane or I'll go insane
Well, I don't see you and it's getting dark
Today we should have gone to Central Park
Well, don't you want to see me ever again?
If not I'll meet you on the astral plane
The astral plane for late at night
The astral plane or I'd go insane
Well, we've known each other from other lives
I want to see you today
But I'll prove my knowledge of what's inside
When I intercept you on the astral plane
The astral plane for late at night
The astral plane or I'll go insane
Alright
Well, I don't see you and it's getting dark
I'd have a lot to say
But you're not the one that I can say it to
At least not today
Oh well, I don't remember it afterwords
I don't yet know the words!
But I know we've been together just this week
We've been together on the astral plane
The astral plane for late at night
The astral plane or I'd go insane
Well, the old world may be dead
Our parents can't understand
But I still love my parents
And I still love the old world
Oh, I had a New York girlfriend
And she couldn't understand how I could
Still love my parents and still love the old world
So I told her:
I want to keep my place in the old world
Keep my place in the arcane
Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world
Alright
I say old world
I say old world
I say
Well, I see a '50's apartment house
Bleak in the morning sun
But I still love the '50's
And I still love the old world
I wanna keep my place in the old world
Keep my place in the arcane
Cause I still love my parents and I still love the old world
Alright
I see the '50's apartment house
It's bleak in the 1970's sun
But I still love the '50's
And I still love the old world
I wanna keep my place in this old world
Keep my place in the arcane knowledge
And I still love the '50's and I still love the old world
Alright now we say bye bye old world
Gotta help the new world
Oh, bye bye
I say bye bye bye bye old world
Well, some people try to pick up girls
And get called assholes
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare and
So Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Well, the girls would turn the color
Of the avocado when he would drive
Down their street in his El Dorado
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not like you
Alright
Well, he was only 5'3"
But girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso never got called an asshole
Not in New York
Oh well, be not schmuck, be not obnoxious
Be not bellbottom bummer or asshole
Remember the story of Pablo Picasso
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare
Pablo Picasso was never called an asshole
Alright this is it
Well
Some people try to pick up girls
And they get called an asshole
This never happened to Pablo Picasso
He could walk down your street
And girls could not resist his stare and so
Pablo Picasso was never called...
Well, she was sensitive
She understood me
She understood the European things of 1943
But she does all these things that I can't stand
I can't care if she stays with another man
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Well, she cracked, I won't
She did things that I don't
She'd self destroy, necessary to self enjoy
I self develop, necessary to self help
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Well, she cracked, I won't
She did things that I don't
She'd eat garbage, eat shit, get stoned
I stay alone, eat health food at home
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
Alright
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
One more time
One more time
She cracked, I'm sad, but I won't
She cracked, I'm hurt, you're right
When you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes
And when you get out of the dating bar
I'll be here to get back into your life
I can't stand what you do
I'm in love with your eyes
Oh, I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes
I go to bakeries all day long
There's a lack of sweetness in my life
And there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
Oh, there is pain inside
You can see it in my eyes
Makes me think about me
That I've lost my pride
But I'm in love with this power that resides in your eyes
You live in modern apartments
Well, I even got scared once or twice
Last time I walked down your street
There were tears in my eyes
Well, now these streets
We all know
They help us cry when we're alone late at night
Don't you love them too?
That where you got your eyes?
Oh, I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
How I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes
Now... your world
It is beautiful
I'll take the subway to your suburb sometime
I'll seek out the places that must have been magic
To your little girl mind
Now as a little girl
You must have been magic
I still get jealous of your old boyfriends
In the suburbs sometimes
And when I walk down your street
Probably be tears in my eyes
I can't stand what you do
Sometimes I can't stand you
And it makes me think about me
That I'm involved with you
But I'm in love with this power that shows through in your eyes
So... when you get out of the hospital
Let me back into your life
I can't stand what you do
But I'm in love with your eyes
Well, I don't want just a girl to fool around with
Well, I don't want just a girl to ball alright
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all
Alright
Well, I won't pretend I like a girl if I really don't
And act like she's great when she makes me feel appalled
All I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all
Well, I don't want some cocaine sniffing triumph in the bar
Well, I don't want a triumph in the car
I don't want to make a rich girl crawl
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want no one at all
Alright, listen to this now
Picture this:
I'm walking with my girlfriend
28 misguided souls combined say, "We're moving in"
There's a certain kind of girl that you care about so much
You say, "I don't care what you guys do to me, but her, don't touch!"
'Cause I don't want just a girl to fool around with
I don't want just a girl to ball
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all
Oh, alright
Well, I don't want a girl to fool around with no
I don't want just a girl to ball no
What I want is a girl that I care about
Or I want nothing at all
Alright gentlemen
If I were to walk to the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston
Well, first I'd go to the room where they keep the Cezanne
But if I had by my side a girlfriend
Then I could look through the paintings
I could look right through them
Because I'd have found something that I understand
I understand a girlfriend
That's a girl friend
Said G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
That's a girlfriend, baby
That's something that I understand
Alright
I walk through the Fenway
I have my heart in my hands
I understand a girlfriend
That's a girl friend
Oh, that's a G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
Well, that's a girlfriend, baby
That's something that I understand
Four o'clock in the afternoon in the Fenway
I have my heart in my hands
I undertand a girlfriend
That's a girlfriend
That's G-I-R-L-F-R-E-N
That's a girlfriend, baby
Well, that's something that I understand
Well, there's sex in the sunny day
That shines down on Boylston Street
And I love the U.S.A
So share the modern world with me
Cause I'm in love with the U.S.A. now
I'm in love with the modern world now
Put down your cigarette
And drop out of B.U
Alright
That's right
Well, out in the afternoon
Out in the arid plane
We'll share a modern love
Under suburban rain
And me in love with the U.S.A. now
And me in love with the modern world now
Put down the cigarette
And act like a true girl, oh
Well, out on Route 9
It's bleak and nearly dying
Stop all this weak stuff
And drop out of B.U.!
With me in love with the U.S.A. now
Me in love with the modern world now
Put down the cigarette
And drop out of high school, oh
Oh, that's right
Well, I'm in love with the U.S.A. now
I'm in love with the modern world now
Put down the cigarette
And act like a true girl
Well, listen
Well, the modern world is not so bad
Not like the students say
In fact I'd be in heaven
If you'd share the modern world with me
With me in love with the U.S.A. now
With me in love with the modern world now
Put down the cigarette
And share the modern world with me
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Sleeps on water, walks on ice (Ice!)
Sleeps on water, walks on ice
Got no father, immortal wife
I'd exchange my soul for her
There's no antidote for her
I'd exchange my life for her
There's no antidote for her
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Like a dancing flame on a bed of nails
She is one thing that you cannot buy
With zero reasons for living
With zero reasons for living
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Our only defense is to gather as an army
I'll hold you like a gun
Our only defense is to gather as an army
I'll hold you like a gun
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
My little girl was born on a ray of sound
Western values mean nothing to her, nothing to her
Western values mean nothing to her, nothing to her
She's the girl of our dreams
She's the girl of our dreams
She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond good and evil
She is beyond
I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire
We do not have anything
We have not learned anything
We do not know anything
Do not understand
We do not sell anything
We do not help
But we will betray
And we will not forget
I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire
Fire, fire, fire
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Reject varying concepts of law and discipline
Oh, oh, I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
I admit my crime, crime, crime
I'm a thief of fire, fire, fire, fire
But who to trust
When you're stealing from a nation of killers
Do I trust myself?
I'm like a tramp in its cage
Flower in Moscow
Losers take all
We are here to go
All lovers betray
I admit my crime
I'm a thief of fire
Set fire to yourself on a train
Don't approach your life with a sword
Burning breast your heart's in flame
But your eyelids shield you from the law
I won't stamp on your coal eyes
That poison tongue tasted stone
Built out of tears so you cannot lie
The voice of the wind tells you you are not alone
Snow girl, I burn you
Snow girl, I melt you
Your hair is on fire
When I touch you you melt
Strong in the shadows
But you cannot leave your room
Knife inside you sharpens its blade
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail
Tick tick hammer and nail
Snow girl, I burn you
Snow girl, I melt you
Your hair is on fire
When I touch you you melt
Snow girl, snow girl
I burn you, I melt you
Teeth beckon you
Who says guns speak louder
Money's a weapon of terror
Spiders I can trust open my chest
An order is an order
Even when it makes no sense
An order is an order
Even when
An order is an order
Spiders I can trust open my
Teeth beckon you
Man trap
Thumb screw
Skulls teeth shine
Iron maiden
We are hungry and cold
Spiders I can trust open my chest
Boil my heart alive
Money's a weapon of terror
Who says guns speak louder who says guns speak louder
What does it feel like to kill a man
How can you wash the blood off your hands
Mercenary, missionary, mercenary, missionary
What does it feel like to kill a man?
No waiting, No running
No searching behind
I will break you time
I will break your mind
Waiting
Is a crime
All will be now, dreams are too fast
You are the first, we are the last
Last, last
We are last
No sequence to follow
No fear of tomorrow
Kiss of neverness
Life of timelessness
We'll break the speed of change
We'll tame eternity
Time is within you
Shines through your eyes
We'll kill the word
Black letter lies
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies
Your world is built on lies
Time, time
Catch up on your bill
You got the works, so
But what to do now?
I, you, we
Are time
I, you, we are
Time
Break
Tame
Eternity
Time trinity shines through your eyes
Oh, we'll kill the word, black letter lies
Black letter lies
Black letter lies
How it's in your uncertainty
I'll break your mind
To climb
All will be now, dreams are too fast
You are the first
We are the last
Are the last
Don't let time
Catch up on your bill
You got the works, so
But what to do now?
I, you, we
Are time
I, you, we
Are time
I will break you time
It's a crime
Always we are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are, are, we are, we are, we are
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are, we are, we are, we are, we are, we are
We are time
We are time
I was waiting for a mermaid to appear
Saying come little boy drown your fear
So young we're the new explorers
With the spirit of Doctor Livingston
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
We won't die together in the desert
We'll escape from the men of prey
We'll smile like the French Resistance
And laugh at the guillotine
We'll talk to the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Disapproved of life around them
So they created a world of their own
You're my last request before the firing squad
But bullets cannot penetrate the sea
We'll hide in the savage sea
It's the only direction for you and me
Why should heroes always die in battle
Take the violin
We're exiles
Scream of my heartbeat
Those who know don't speak
Speak the unspoken
First words of a child
Words which make black white
Words which make men bite
Words which make the air bleed
Scream of my heartbeat
Truth is a feeling
But it's not a sound
Truth is a feeling
But it's not a sound
We don't need words
Throw them away
Please don't blame me
Words disobey me
Speak the first word
Speak the last word
Please don't blame me
Words disobey me
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
This is the age of chance
This is the age of chance
Don't call me pain
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Being afraid is power
T-O-R-T-U-R-E
Soldiers soldiers soldiers
March through your eyes
Obey because you either love or fear
Mercy mercy mercy
Let U.S. bleed happily
Let U.S. bleed in peace
Nothing is impossible
When you're living on the brink
Shown the world
But cut off your hands
We fear what we do not understand
Soldiers soldiers soldiers
March through your eyes
Fire your finger in the dark
Fire your finger in the dark
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
Don't Call Me Pain
My name is mystery
This is the age of chance so they say
Jungle protects the past
Jungle protects the past
Man in white pressed finger tips
Against sunstained bodies
Steaming skins and silver hair
Even better than a medal
Even better than a medal
When in Rome
Electronic cavemen
When in Rome
Propeller dying
When in Rome
Silently praying
My honour is my loyalty
Is life more precious than property
Here comes the bride
All dressed in white
Time to think
Can we have a little more light
Palm oil
Surrounded by burnt bodies
Over the phone came hate
Why do the girls always follow the boys from Brazil
Why do the girls always follow the boys from Brazil
Why have I been spared
Vengeance
Why have I been spared if not for vengeance
Vengeance for those wasted years
If we forget the past we're doomed to repeat it
Speak chain lightning
Words of blue glass
Smash the sound barrier
Steal the speed of light
Bury the sun
And drink up
Drink up the night
Please don't sell your dreams
Please don't sell your dreams
Speak chain lightning
Paint a new sound
Strike a new colour
Catch catch catch a thought
Tears of dust, swallowed by the air
Please don't sell your dreams
Please don't sell your dreams
Don't live in somebody else's dream
Don't live in somebody else's dream
It makes no difference
Night or day
No one teaches you how to live
Cups of tea are a clock
A clock, a clock, a clock
The times I forgot but never forgot
I don't know the books that you read
But you don't say that
Love never externalizes
You're rereading a book
To feel reassured
By the life of your favorite hero
But don't worry, honey don't worry
This is just a fairytale
Happening in the supermarket
The roots of your thoughts
They're essentially polaroidal
When you look at my picture
Don't say it's your mirror
Don't say we're both paranoid
Tear me - make me glad
Don't ask me anything
I'm no secret agent
Got no colours to give to you
But don't worry, honey don't worry
This is just a fairytale
Happening in the supermarket
I hear the music outside
And I am the music inside
No side to fall in
No fall to live until
My mind is still
My mind, my life
I don't mind today
I hear the music outside
And I am the music inside
No side to fall in
No fall to live until
My mind is still
My mind, my life
I don't mind today
Passion that shouts
And red with anger
I lost myself
Through alleys of mysteries
I went up and down
Like a demented train
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Searching for something
That makes makes hearts move
I found myself
But my best possession
Walked in to the shade
And threaten to drift away
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Full of myself
I left you behind
As if I could, possessed by Quixote's dream
Went to fight dragons in the land of concrete
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Just a couple in the park
Pounding out those games in the dark
Those who walk past her screams
Are only reminded of love's young dreams
A scuffle, violating arms
Can only prove the strength of his charms
Woman, you're pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier's life is very tough
Needs tender loving when fighting's through
Join the professionals
(The professionals)
Yes they're really strangers in the night
Oh they're saying to me if you put up a fight
It's not just a kiss you owe me
It's all this ammunition loaded
I bought you a drink
And well, we're walking hand in hand
Woman, you're pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier's life is very tough
Needs tender loving when fighting's through
Save the professional
(The professionals)
Seaside town, off-duty trip
Taking flesh, going to let it rip
With rings on his finger
Sharp like the taste that still lingers
Flavor of this month - center spread
57 Page Three varieties in his head
Woman, you're pinned up
On the wall in front of you
A soldier's life is very tough
Needs tender loving when fighting's through
Join the professionals
Save one of the professionals
(No, no jail for the professional)
Is it love when I see your face on the rails?
Is it love when I see your face on the rails?
When the black and white landscape
Makes me write this black and white song?
Is it love when I fear you talking to me?
Is it love when I fear you talking to me
And discover it was just a longing
Turned into a black and white song?
Is it love when I don't know who you are?
Is it love when I don't know who you are?
And have to look out of the window
To write this black and white song?
I met her in a club down in Old Soho
Where you drink champagne and it tastes just like cherry-cola
C-O-L-A cola
She walked up to me and she asked me to dance
I asked her her name and in a dark brown voice she said Lola
L-O-L-A Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
I'm not the world's most physical guy
But when she squeezed me tight she almost broke my spine
Oh my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well I'm not dumb but I can't understand
Why she walks like a woman and talks like a man
Oh my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well we drank champagne and danced all night
Under electric candlelight
She picked me up and sat me on her knee
And said little boy won't you come home with me
Well I'm not the world's most passionate guy
But when I looked in her eyes well I almost fell for my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
I pushed her away
I walked to the door
I fell to the floor
I went down on my knees
Then I looked at her and she at me
That's the way that I want it to stay
And I always want it to be that way for my Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Girls will be boys and boys will be girls
It's a mixed up muddled up shook up world except for Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Well I left home just a week before
And I'd never ever kissed a woman before
Lola smiled and took me by the hand
And said "Little boy I'm gonna make you a man"
Well I'm not the world's most masculine man
But I know what I am and I'm glad I'm a man
And so is Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
Lo-lo-lo-lo Lola
A feeling of being followed
A feeling of being watched
Isn't easy to define
So I won't trouble you
She put her life on the line
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could not
Her logic was too tangled
I couldn't untangle it
How can silence or expression
Stop or start here for anyone
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could not
She's got her back to the wall
Some are gone but we're still here
This train is arriving
Steel wheels
She wants to feel
She kept trying
Trying to find
A place to hide
Somewhere inside
Somewhere where the air was hot
And her blood could rush
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
But she could not
Stop here
This is for you
As my love that was for nobody
As the rain that didn't wet you
And the sun that didn't warm you
Stop here
This is for you
You don't need to pay
Because it didn't cost me anything
Stop here and go away
Take your time with you
I haven't the time for you
My feelings were fueled by yours
The walls that surrounded my city
Stop here
This is for you
As my love that was for nobody
You're a million and I've loved you
You're a million and I'm yours
You're a million, I'm not yours
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
We're a million to come
We're a million to go
When I looked at the streets
And when they looked at me
When I looked at the streets
And when they looked at me
The void
(When I try to think)
The void could only stop being
When I....
One, two, three
Three, two, one
One, two, three
Three, two, one
Nill, nill
When I looked at the streets
And when you were talking
When I tried to think
When I tried to think
I can't do a thing today
I can't see anyway
I haven't eaten all day
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
I can't listen to what you say
I can't understand you anyway
I haven't spoken all day
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
Felling good, felling bad
Felling happy, felling sad
I'm so happy, happy sad
In love is so tough on my emotion
In love is so tough on my emotion
I don't your feelings
I do not need you
He put sugar in his coffee
He stirred coffee with a teaspoon
He poured milk into sweetened coffee
He lifted the cup up to his lips
He drank coffee 'til was empty
He put cup back onto saucer
Without looking at me
Without looking at me
He took cigarette from his packet
He lit cigarette with his matches and
He blew smoke rings with the smoke
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
He put his hat onto his head
He put raincoat 'cos it was raining and
Oh he did have no umbrella
And he left in the rain
Without looking at me
Without talking to me
Silently no looking
Talking to no one else
Leaving me without looking
Looking at me without leaving
Leaving me without looking
Silently without looking
You leaving me, leaving me
Looking at me without speaking
Speaking to me without looking
Looking at me without talking
Talking to me without leaving
Leaving me without looking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
I'm not looking, I'm not talking, I'm not looking, I'm not talking
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking at me, no looking at me
No looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking, I'm not looking at me
He is a boy
He's very thin
Until tomorrow
Took heroin
Don't like himself very much
'Cause he has set to set to self-destruct
He is
Set to self-destruct
He is
Too good to be true
Enjoy it
Destroy it
He is
Too good to be true
He is
Set to self-destruct (set to self-destruct)
Enjoy it
Destroy it
I could
Hate you anytime
I could
Give you anything
Enjoy it
Destroy it
I forgive you anything
But I could
Hate you anytime
Enjoy it
Destroy it
He is
Set to self-destruct
Thanks a lot
He had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So tough
You can't take anymore now you're getting weak
So tough
Don't start playing hide and seek
So hard
Why do you think he got like that?
So hard
Don't think about it much 'cause it's just a rut
You had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So strong
They say you're acting like a star
So strong
They say not everything's wonderbar
Too long
You want money, girls urgently
Too long
Too much, too soon you wait and see
Too much
You hang around her 'cause she's a good mate
Too much
Milkshakes and cherry cheesecake
Too fast
They want to stop you having kicks
Slow down
Don't fuck things up by getting sick again
You had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
So tough
You can't take anymore now you're getting weak
So tough
Don't start playing hide and seek
So hard
Why do you think he got like that?
So hard
Don't think about it much 'cause it's just a rut
You had fun experience
Nothing he does ever makes sense
He is only curious
Don't take it serious
I am trapped in a flood, but it isn't raining
I have a tendency to get bored too quickly
Recently my dull life seems to have no meaning
I am stuck with someone, we're not communicating
I want to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feeling
Walking down the street looking in the windows
The TV, the lights flickering in other peoples windows
Imagine myself moving in the kitchens
Somehow I don't know, it just looks so tempting
I want to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feeling
I've got a new, improved remedy
Two of my lonely fantasies
When I supply myself with something new...
Going home, into bed when I've treated myself
I've been quite hard, after a hard day's work
I have found a hundred ways to get rid of all my worries
He's not pillaging, stopping me, committing a crime
I have to buy
(Have you been affected?)
I need consoling
(You could be addicted)
I need something new
Something trivial would do
I want to satisfy this empty feeling
I've got a new improved remedy
Two of my lonely fantasies
Put the cheddar in the pocket
Put the rest under the jacket
Talk to the cashier, he won't suspect
And if he does...
Do a runner!
Ten quid for the lot
We pay fuck all
Babylonian won't lose much
And we'll have dinner tonight
Do a runner!
Camera's trying to watch us
Mirrors and TV
But they're not gonna catch us
'Cause we're gonna gonna gonna run run run
Do a runner!
Run!
Ten quid for the lot
We pay fuck all
Babylonian won't lose much
And we'll have dinner tonight
Do a runner!
Run!
(I've pissed in my knickers)
(FM, FM)
I live in a town with a hundred lights around
My head is like a radio set
I'm waiting to hear what program is next
What program is next? (FM)
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear
They say it's all right, but suspicion creeps in
My nightmares don't project my dreams
I can't but wonder what's feeding my screen
What's feeding my screen? (FM)
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear
Thousand nights of confusion wedged in my mind
Breaking down another illusion
Today's transmission will give me the solution
Frequent Mutilation transmits over the air
Serving for the purpose
Of those who want you to fear

I knew you were sitting in your room all alone
I knew I was the only girl for you
You have told me so
But somehow it slipped my mind
Whilst walking home
Whilst you were sulking I could have been raped
In Ladbroke Grove
Well you can have your records back
And take your comics too
I'm going to have some fun tonight
Life's better without you
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So I listen to the radio
Smoke a cigarette
Same old thing, yeah I know
Everybody does it
Six months
Have passed, now try become between us
I never missed you, only sometimes
Dreaming on a bus
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind
That you and I have grown apart
For the first time
Seeing you with other girls
Sometimes bothers me
But I don't want to play those games
They're just not interesting
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So I listen to the radio
Smoke a cigarette
Same old thing, yeah I know
Everybody does it
Since yesterday, like I heard your voice behind me
I froze on the spot, did not turn around
In case you'd find me
I think you lied or you can't tell
Tell the truth
You didn't want me, you wanted someone else
Who'd give you proof
But I can't trust the feelings rushing through my head
I'd wait for you to call me nights
And come to me instead
So I spend an evening
Without getting my face cut
And another evening
Without getting run over
Again another evening without falling in love
So listen to the radio
Smoke a cigeratte
Same old thing, yeah you know
Everybody does it
Babylon love us...oh Babylon love us
Oh oh oh sweet love und romance
Ain't it something?
Man, let's dance!
Want you with me all the time

Don't create
Don't rebel
Have intuition
Can't decide
Typical girls get upset too quickly
Typical girls can't control themselves
Typical girls are so confusing
Typical girls, you can always tell
Typical girls don't think too clearly
Typical girls are unpredictable, predictable
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well, well
Typical girls are looking for something
Typical girls fall under spells
Typical girls buy magazines
Typical girls feel like hell
Typical girls worry about spots, fat
And natural smells, stinky fake smells
Typical girls try to be
Typical girls very well
Can't decide what clothes to wear
Typical girls are sensitive
Typical girls are emotional
Typical girls are cruel and bewitching
But she's a femme fatalle
Typical girls stand by their man
Typical girls are really swell
Typical girls learn how to act shocked
Typical girls don't rebel
Who invented the typical girl?
Who's bringing out the new improved model?
And there's another marketing ploy
Typical girl gets the typical boy
The typical boy gets the typical girl
The typical girl gets the typical boy
Are emotional
Passion that shouts
And red with anger
I lost myself
Through alleys of mysteries
I went up and down
Like a demented train
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Searching for something
That makes makes hearts move
I found myself
But my best possession
Walked into the shade
And threatened to drift away
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Full of myself
I left you behind
As if I could
Possessed by Quixote's dream
Went to fight dragons
In the land of concrete
Don't take it personal
I choose my own fate
I follow love
I follow hate
Rolling in pain
Discovered what hurts
And tasted hell
Infatuated by madness
I danced in flames
And drunk in the depth of love
I bet, I bet, I bet
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other guy you knew before
We're two of a kind, you know I love you more
It took me by surprise I must say
When I found out yesterday
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be mine
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine
I am just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh)
I know a man ain't supposed to cry, ha
But these tears I can't hold inside
Losin' you would mean my life, you see
Cause you mean that much to me
You could have told me yourself
That you love, love
I heard it through the bass line
How not much longer will you be mine
Oh I heard it through the grapevine
And I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey yeah
(Heard it through the grapevine)
(Not much longer would you be my baby, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh)
People say believe half of what you see
Run and hide from what you hear
But I can't help bein' confused
If it's true please tell me dear
Do you plan to let me go
For this other guy you knew before?
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be mine
Oh, babe I heard it through the grapevine
Ooh I'm just about to lose my mind
Honey, honey
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
Heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I heard it through the grapevine
Not much longer will you be my baby
I bet you're wondering how I knew
'Bout your plans to make me blue
With some other girl you knew before
We're two of a kind, you know I love you more
Do you plan to let me go
For this other guy you knew before?
Just about to lose my mind
I'm just about to lose my mind, honey
I'm just about to lose my mind
And I'm just about to lose my mind
So many feelings
Pent up in here
Left all alone, I'm with
The one I most fear
I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Just want to break out
Shake off this skin
I, I can't
Escape myself
All my problems
Loom larger than life
I can't swallow
Another slice
Seems like my shadow
Mocks every stride
Can I learn to live with
What's trapped inside?
I, I can't
Escape myself
So many feelings
Pent up in here
Left all alone, I'm with
The one I most fear
I'm sick and I'm tired
Of reasoning
Just wanna break out
Shake off this skin
I, I can't
Escape myself
I, I can't
Escape myself
I, I, I can't
Escape myself
Setting out
City in your sights
You want an overview of the underground
The pressure's off
So your feelings rise, you gotta hit that peak
Before you crash back down
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
All mixed up
In the heartland heat
A chemistry of commotion and style
You're thrown in
You've got to lose yourself before you find yourself
Back in exile
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe
You gotta believe in a heartland
In a heartland
In a heartland
I said you gotta believe
In a heartland
I hate the quiet times
I need some company
I miss the noise of life
The silence deafens me
The seconds split so slow
The minutes I can't kill
I keep an eye on the time
I catch it standing still
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
Try to find my place
Sometimes I get so near
I journey aimless days
But always end up here
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
In my hour of need
My need gnaws at me
My need claws at me
My need lurks inside
It won't be pacified
To say what must be said
And nothing else instead
To reach and grope no more
To grab the core
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
My need gnaws at me
My need claws at me
My need lurks inside
It won't be pacified
To say what must be said
And nothing else instead
To reach and grope no more
To grab the core
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
Information
Recitation
Communication
That's the complication
Words fall, words fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart
Words fall, words they fall short, fall short
When I try to reach the gulf
They fall short
Words fail, words fail me
Trying to speak from the heart
Of my heart, heart, heart, heart
Deep in the country
The factories hide
Where they make the missiles
That run our lives
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
They've got the money
They've got the know-how
It's all above our heads
It's coming down now
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles? Missiles
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
Missiles cause damage
And make an eerie sound
Missiles leave carnage
Where there once was a town
Who the hell makes those missiles?
Who the hell makes those missiles? Missiles
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do
Who the hell makes them?
Who the hell makes them?
Who the hell makes those missiles?
When they know what they can do?
You're so young to be confused
Well, I know that's the time it starts
All the conflict seems to fuse
Leaving you in the dark
Find yourself all at sea
Never thought they'd let you drown
You were trying to find your feet
Can't believe they'd cut you down
Can't believe they'd cut you down
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
You've been pressured into the hard sell
A victim of a nation's scheming
As the expectations swell
You retreat inside your dreaming
Find yourself all at sea
Never thought they'd let you drown
You were trying to find your feet
Can't believe they'd cut you down
Can't believe they'd cut you down
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
In your heyday, heyday
Heyday
Heyday
Heyday
Heyday
We are young
But are we strong?
We've held out
For so long
Now we're in
Jeopardy
Now we're in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
We knew our
Ideals were high
The lower we sink
The less we care why
I know we're in
Jeopardy
I know we're in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Lost the will
To keep up the pace
Dead on my feet
Defeat on my face
I know I'm in
Jeopardy
I know I'm in
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Such a slow
Steady slide
Takes away
So much inside
And what's left?
Jeopardy
What's left?
Jeopardy, jeopardy
Jeopardy, jeopardy
I'm in jeopardy, jeopardy
From the dark hill the huddled homes
Shine like sequins and sapphires
Families each sealed inside
The frail fortress peace of mind requires
A switch is snapped, and the borderline
Between night and day is gone
Between shifting sea and firm ground
Between savage and civilisation
Sleep guides unseen
Into new territory every night
Abandons us to what we keep
Enslaved within the hours of light
Caught in the comfort of my trap
Where it's easier to die than to fight back
Half-dead, but I hope it's not too late
To take some action and change my fate
Hold on
Hold out
Resistance
Lost in the white-out, I'm under the snow
The more I struggle, the further down I go, down I go
Half-dead, but I hope it's not too late
To take some action and change my fate
Hold on
Hold out
Resistance
Resistance
Resistance
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist!
Resist! Resist! (Resistance)
Resistance!
We stab at our faith to keep it alive
We draw the blood but the law draws the line
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, and life is life
We could go anywhere
It would still be the same
A change of climate, a change of air
All the pressure would remain
I can read the unwritten law
I can read the unwritten law
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, life is life
A hand is a hand, a knife is a knife
Blood is blood, and life is life
The unwritten law
The unwritten law
In the dark, near the heart
Close to real desire
In my words, in my eyes
Can't you feel the desire?
We will wait for the night
We will wait for desire
Bittersweet, laugh and cry
Tears that taste of desire
Hunted down, through the days
Caught in nets of desire
Feel the loss as it fades
Can't forget desire
Keep in touch, keep in track
Of this thing called desire
There'll be times when we'll do
Anything for desire
Hunted down, through the days
Caught in nets of desire
Feel the loss as it fades
Can't forget desire
Keep in touch, keep in track
Keep within the reach of desire
There'll be times when we'll do
Anything for desire
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will wait
We will wait for the night
We will wait
Huh!

You are now in a deep sleep
(In-store promises)
Endless possibilities, a life of ease
A life cocooned in a routine of food
(Stimulus and response!)
Softness is a thing called comfort
(It doesn't cost much to keep in touch)
We never forget you have a choice
Possibilities in store, a taste of paradise
Success on a plate for you, endless promises
(Sleep, sleep, sleep, go to sleep)
Sleep, go to sleep
You are now in a deep sleep
Sleep, sleep, go to sleep
Sleep, go to sleep
You are now in a deep sleep
Well, what do we expect?
Paper hats?
Or maybe even roses?
The sounds of explosions?
Oh no, is this any easier?
Comfy? Climax? Ego?
Decorations up or down?
The sound of explosions?
What does this tune signify?
What is its meaning?
Is it really that straightforward?
Or are our ears beyond words?
Through dirty net curtains
You look at me
Why is it I can't see through to you?
The mesh, it is in your favour (Under my steady gaze)
How will you move (Frozen mid-step)
When the angles are reversed? (You cannot move)
Triumph of the will (triumph of the will)
Triumph of the will (triumph of the will)

We are all Romans, unconscious collective
We are all Romans, we live to regret it
We are all Romans and we know all about straight roads
Every straight road leads home, home to Rome
Two plus two equals four
Four plus four equals eight
We organise via property as power
Slavehood and freedom, imperial purple
Pax Romana!
Suckled by a she-wolf, we turn against our brother
Bella, bella, bella
Bellorum, bellis, bellis
Veni, vidi, vici
I came, I saw, I conquered
We're all Romans, unconscious collective
We are all Romans, we live to regret it
We are all Romans and we know all about straight roads
Every straight road leads home, home to Rome
Two plus two equals four
Four plus four equals eight
We organise via property as power
Slavehood and freedom, imperial purple
Pax Romana!
Suckled by a she-wolf, we turn against our brother
Bella, bella, bella

We're all Romans
History, history repeats itself
History repeats itself
Remembrance Sunday
A war to end all war
And the war that came after that
To keep freedom's flag flying
Lest we forget
The glorious dead
Poppy day, remember poppies are red
And the fields are full of poppies
History, history repeats itself
History repeats itself
History repeats itself
And when the lights go on again
All over the world
And when the boys come home
All over the world
Rain and snow will be all that fall
From out of the sky
A kiss won't mean goodbye
When Johnny comes marching home
Shrinkwrap, you lie, you lie, you lie
Wolf in sheep's clothing
Enshrine our latest product
Define the hollow spaces
(Stimulus and response)
Mobilised cellophane
Untouched by human hands
Don't look a gift horse in the mouth
Don't bite the hand that feeds you
You can have your cake and eat it
It's an expanding universe
"Makeshift", she sings
In her native German
You try to understand what she's trying to say
She says, "You're only as good
As the words you understand"
And you, you don't understand a word
Tower of Babel, Swahili
It's all Greek to me
Bi-lingual, double dutch
Gift of the gab, gift of the gab
We give you firewater, you give us your land
"White man speak with forked tongue"
But it's too late now to start complaining
Too late
Monosyllabic, hieroglyphic
Et cetera, et cetera
Tower of Babel, Swahili
It's all Greek to me
New lamps for old, new lamps for old
Rhubarb rhubarb, rhubarb rhubarb
Rhubarb rhubarb, rhubarb rhubarb
"We hold these truths to be self evident
That all men are created equal
That they are endowed by their Creator with certain rights
That among these are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness
- That to secure these rights
Governments are instituted among men
Deriving their just powers from the consent of the governed
- That whenever any form of government
Becomes destructive of these ends
It is the right of the people to alter or abolish it."
Eat, drink, and be merry
For tomorrow we die
Eat electricity
Drink five of the seven seas
Here is paralyzed sleet
Here is bubble bath rain
Acrid stench and festering tongue
New York to Moscow, Nairobi in flames
I don't know either
What is the answer?
We were told to expect more
And now that we've got more
We want more, we want more
We have moved from A to X
This welfare state is our progress
The size of it all carries us along
More equals better, it's what we want
Our energy is endless, it seems
It's there when we need it
We've got men on the job
We finance clinics to research
A cure for cancer, our least vague fear
A new kind of water
A new way of breathing
Always, somehow, a wonder cure-all
Turns up when we need it
We've got men on the job
You know from experience
The creature comforts, a house that's warm
Your body would choose all this
Of course! It's innate, we're selfish
But what if there's not enough to go round?
Defense is needed
They've got some odd men in odd jobs
We have moved from A to Z
This nuclear state is our demise
Fly away Peter, hide away Paul
Who can watch as the Earth burns, shatters, and dies?
Fail-safe, foolproof, we've heard that before
Good sense is needed
Let's hope we've got men on the job
The size of it all carries us along
More equals better, it's what we want
You know from experience
Your body would choose all this
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one
Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry
Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
Body and beats, I stain my sheets
I don't even know why
My girlfriend, she's at the end
She is starting to cry
When I'm out walkin', I strut my stuff
Yeah, and I'm so strung out
I'm high as a kite, I just might
Stop to check you out
Let me go on...
Like I blister in the sun
Let me go on...
Big hands, I know you're the one
I need someone, a person to talk to
Someone who'd care to love
Could it be you?
Could it be you?
The situation gets rough, and I start to panic
It's not enough, it's just a habit
And, kid, you're sick
Well, darling, this is it
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time
I hope you know that this will go down on your permanent record!
Oh, yeah? Well, don't get so distressed
Did I happen to mention that I'm impressed?
I take one, one, one 'cause you left me
And two, two, two for my family
And three, three, three for my heartache
And four, four, four for my headaches
And five, five, five for my lonely
And six, six, six for my sorrow
And seven, seven for no tomorrow
And eight, eight, I forget what eight was for
But nine, nine, nine for the lost gods
Ten, ten, ten, ten for everything, everything, everything
Well, you can all just kiss off into the air
Behind my back, I can see them stare
They'll hurt me bad, but I won't mind
They'll hurt me bad, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
Yeah, they do it all the time (yeah, yeah!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time (do it all the time!)
They do it all the time, do it all the time, do it all the time
Tell ya, man, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
Of course to me, she mean all t' world
But then she like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry
So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Now I wonder, I wonder what she would say
If I told her, if I told her I felt this way
You know it might make her turn, might make her turn
Might make her turn either way
So all I can do is patiently pray, pray, pray, pray, pray
So please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
How long can the days go on when my love is so strong?
And I know I cannot tell a lie, I want to see him go bye
Goodbye, bye, goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
I'll tell you, man, I'm stuck, I'm stuck, I'm stuck on this lovely girl
And y'know I'd travel, I could travel over the whole world
And you know what she does, she turn around and like another guy
I fall down dead, she never see the tears I cry
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please do not go
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, you hurt me so
Please, please, please, I've got something to show
Day after day, I will walk and I will play
But the day after today, I will stop and I will start
Why can't I get just one kiss?
Why can't I get just one kiss?
There may be some things that I wouldn't miss
But I look at your pants and I need a kiss
Why can't I get just one screw?
Why can't I get just one screw?
Believe me, I know what to do
But something won't let me make love to you
Why can't I get just one fuck?
Why can't I get just one fuck?
I guess it's got something to do with luck
But I waited my whole life for just one...
Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight
Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
Have you kept your eye, your eye on your son?
I know you've had problems, you're not the only one
When your sugar left, he left you on the run
Oh, ma-mama, mama-mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and you got him a gun
So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you've got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
So don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
You know you've got my sympathy
But don't shoot, shoot, shoot that thing at me
Broken down kitchen at the top of the stairs
Can I mix in with your affairs?
Share a smoke, make a joke
Grasp and reach for a leg of hope
Words to memorize, words hypnotize
Words make my mouth exercise
Words all failed the magic prize
Nothing I can say when I'm in your thighs
Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
I would love to love you, lover
City is restless, it's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce
Oh, ma-mama, mo-ma, mo-ma mother
I would love to love you, lover
City is restless, it's ready to pounce
Here in your bedroom, ounce for ounce
I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says, "Wait a minute, honey, I'm gonna add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Day after day, I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow and say goodnight
People worry, what are they worrying about today?
People worry, what are they worrying about today?
Seems like there's a good reason to worry, worry, worry
Seems like there's a damn good reason to worry, worry, worry
I'd sit around, I'd listen to your story if I wasn't in such a hurry, hurry, hurry
And I'm so lonely, I just don't think I can take it any more
And I'm so lonely, I just don't know what to do
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna crawl away and die
And I'm so lonely, feel like I'm gonna hack it apart
I'm gonna hack, hack, hack, hack it apart
Seems like there's a good reason to be lonely, lonely, lonely
I gotta get someone or somebody or something to make me feel less lonely, lonely, lonely
I know I could do it, I know I could do it if I wasn't so lonely, lonely, lonely
Have we got an army? We'll teach you how to act like a man
Have we got an army? Man, I mean to tell you we can fight
Have we got an army? And we're gonna do it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight
Yeah, they're gonna pay, pay, pay, pay it tonight
Do, do, do, do it tonight...
People worry, what are they worrying about today? People worry
And you see, I've learned my lessons
And I don't even want to hear about your confessions
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become
But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
To prove my love to you?
Special favors come in 31 flavors
We're out of mints, pass the Life Savers
I'm droppin hints, candy for candy-coated tongue
You'd be so good, so very good for me
What do you think? Tell me honestly?
I'm wait-wait-wait-waiting for you to come
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, prove my love to you
Third verse, same as the first
Just last night, I was reminded of
Just how bad it had gotten
And just how sick I had become
But it could change with this relationship
De-derange, we've all been through some shit
And if we're thing, I think this thing's begun
Oh, tell me now, what do I have to do
Yeah, tell me now, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, what do I have to do
I'd do it all, what do I have to do
I'd do it all for you, what do I have to do
I'd do anything, I'd do it all, I'd do it all for you
I'd climb a mountain, I'd cross the ocean, I'd do it it all
Tell me now, what do I have to do to prove my love to you?
You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defenses say I did't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar
Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess
Do you know what it's like to hate when it's way down deep inside?
Oh, God, I hate what's been done to my life
I could rule the pain, I could rule the night
Or would I ruin my salvation?
Ruin my mind, rules your pains, rulers of the night
Ruin your salvation, ruin your mind
You know that I want your loving
But my logic tells me that it ain't never gonna happen
And then my defences say I didn't want it anyway
But you know sometimes I'm a liar
Could you ever want me to love you?
Could you ever want me to care?
Disregard my nervousness, please ignore my vacant stares
'Cause just what I've been through is nothing like where I'm going to
Give me some sign to pursue a promise
And you're unhappy -- this is only a guess
Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun, messing my mind, I kick it around
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill
I ain't no kid in Chicago, I ain't no Al Capone
But there's a windy city in my bedroom alone
I said I don't live in Chicago, I don't know no Al Capone
That bitch took my money, and she went to Chicago
If I ain't already enough, sick and alone...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill
Ain't had no fun, all the time jacking around
Ain't had no fun -- where's it at? It's down, down, it's downtown...
But if it's all right with you, and if it's all right, yes, I will
Aw, c'mon, babe, go ahead to the kill
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
High school smiles, oh yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now I can only guess
'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away
When I see you, eyes will turn blue
When I see you, thousand eyes turnin' blue
'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away
Tell by the way that you switch and walk
I can see by the way that you baby-talk
I can know by the way you treat your man
I can love you, baby, 'til it's a-cryin...
'Cause it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone
Yeah, it's gone, daddy, gone -- your love is gone away
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Fifteen smiles, oh, yes
Beautiful girl, lovely dress
Where she is now, I can only guess 'cause it's...
Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer
Dear lady, there's so many things that I have come to fear
Little voice says I'm going crazy to see all my worlds disappear
Vague sketch of a fantasy laughing at the sunrise like he's been up all night
Ooh, slipping and sliding, what a good time but now, I have to find a bed that can take this weight
Good feeling, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
It always seems like you're leaving when I know the other one just a little too well
Oh, dear lady, won't you stay with me just a little longer?
You know it always seems like you're leaving when I need you here just a little longer
Crossed the path, then I followed your face
It was hard to believe, it was hard to trace
I saw you today, seems like I see your everyday
But there's something I figured out 'bout you...
You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?
You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?
When you smile or a frown, I'm so tired of you being around
Engaged in some sexual acts, well, I'm just gonna have to tell you all the facts
What could that be about, well, here's a clue...
You're so ugly -- I'm tellin' you straight
You're so ugly -- don't make a mistake
'Cause you ugly -- I'm tellin' you that
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?
You're so ugly -- all the time
You're so ugly -- you ain't no friend of mine
'Cause you ugly -- you can bet it on the bank
Say, why, why, why would I lie to you?
Why would I lie? Why would I lie?
You're so ugly -- a-la, la, la, la...
You're so ugly...
Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight

Come on, dad, gimme the car

Woman, woman, woman
I know she's it
'Cause I'm gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
Gonna touch her all over her body
And she can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
She can touch me all over my body
Time goes by, I can feel myself growing old
Burning inside, it's making this boy turn out cold
What's wrong, what's right, I don't care when I hate my life
What's wrong, what's right, you know, people don't care when they hate their life
But how can I explain personal pain, how can I explain personal pain
How can I explain my voice is in vain, how can I explain the deep down
Driving, driving, driving, we're driving, we're driving, we're driving...
Hey, dad, speaking of driving...
Come on, dad, gimme the car tonight
So much he don't understand
Just might never make it to a man
Come on, dad, gimme the car
Come on, dad, I ain't no runt...
Come on, girl, gimme your...
'Cause I ain't had much to live for
I ain't had much to live for
You know I ain't had much to live for
You know I ain't had much to live for
Didn't realize the sign
Because it was a sign of the times
What was coming from the sky?
You never, ever change your mind
'Cause it's taking so long
Didn't realize the crime
Thought you had it mastermind
What you seek is what you find
There's no one else because you're blind
And it's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Didn't realize this time
What is really on top of your mind?
When they're coming from the sky
You never, ever change your mind
Cause it's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking so long
It's taking so long
It's taking, taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking, taking
Taking so long
Who's makin' such a deal?
That's not the way it feels
Who are you lookin' for?
But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used
But how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
When life is one big trail
Take it anyway you will
But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used
And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long can this be?
And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
When life is one big trail
Take it anyway you will
But you get it so confused
That's not the way it's used
And how long can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
How long, can this be?
Through your mirror there is such vanity
Through the light, it broke to me
Can't explain
So you think your thoughts are free?
While your eyes look so far away
Laughing at the wind vanes
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
In your head it isn't what it seems
Why does it have to cause a scene?
Can't explain
So you think your mind is free?
But they'll take it so far away
Leaving no remains
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Through your mirror there is such vanity
Tell me, what is it that it wants from me?
You know, child, we used to be in it for the same thing
Now it's one against the other
What's this price we've got to pay?
You thought your soul was free?
But they'll take it so far away
Leaving no remains
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme
Pushing the extreme, hey
Pushing the extreme, extreme, extreme, extreme, extreme
Land of the free, home of the brave
Do you think we will ever be saved?
In the land of dreams, I find myself sober
Wonder when it'll all be over
Wonder when it'll all be over
All be over
Land of the free, home of the brave
Do you think we will ever be saved?
Living in the void but the void grows colder
Wonder when it'll all be over
Huh, will you be laughing?
When it's over
Will you be laughing?
Laughing
When it's over
When it's over
When it's over
When it's over
Out of the shadows, blistering lights
Through the hallways of a sleepless night
Every time I turn around, it's there
Take a piece of our lives, didn't think we'd care?
Take away the chore
Take all of that, and more
And now we're crying
It's no fair
Through the shadows, blistering lights
As the dreams of your darkness died
Every time I turn around you're there
Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair
Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care?
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair
Take a piece of our lives
Didn't think that we would care?
Now it's no, it's no fair
No fair, no fair, no fair, no fair

Our own correspondent
Is sorry to tell
Of an uneasy time
That all is not well
On the borders there's movement
In the hills there is trouble
Food is short
Crime is double
Prices have risen
Since the government fell
Casualties increase
As the enemy shell
The climate's unhealthy
Flies and rats thrive
And sooner or later
The end will arrive
This is your correspondent
Running out of tape
Gunfire's increasing
Looting, burning, rape...
I wanna be a field day for the Sundays
So they can fuck up my life
Embarrass my wife, and leave a bad taste
That striped toothpaste
Can't remove on Monday mornings
I wanna be a target for the dailies
So they can show
Pictures of me with a nude on page three
So lacking in taste
Touched up near the waist
Looking as limp as Monday morning
Touched up near the waist
Looking as limp as Monday morning
Think of a number
Divide it by two
Something is nothing
Nothing is nothing
Open a box
Tear off the lid
Then think of a number
Don't think of an answer
Open your eyes
Think of a number
Don't get swept under
A number's a number
A chance encounter you want to avoid
The inevitable
So you do, oh yes you do
The impossible
Now you ain't got a number
You just want to rhumba
And there ain't no way
You're gonna go under
Go under, go under
Go under, go under
You tear me asunder
Go under, go under
Go under, yeah
There's great danger (danger)
For the loneliest ranger in town
No silver bullets (bullets)
Tonto's split the scene
Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
There's great danger (danger)
At hand, most caped crusader of all
No cloak of justice (justice)
Robin's quit the scene
Next week will solve your problems
But now, fish fingers all in a line
The milk bottles stand empty
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set (TV)
Stay glued to your TV set, oh why don't ya, don't ya, don't ya? (TV)
Stay glued onto your TV set (TV)
The time is too short but never too long
To reach ahead, to project the image
Which will in time become a concrete dream
Another cigarette, another day
From A to B, again avoiding C, D, and E
'Cause E is where you play the blues
Avoiding a death is to win the game
To avoid delegation, the big E
Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown
That's the lowdown
Drowning in the big swim, rising to the surface
The smell of you
That's the lowdown
Start to move
Time at hand
Bird in hand
No bush but trees thicken
Which now, rooster or chicken?
Leave the past
Feel the wrench
Smell the stench
Was good, but flesh soon rots
Emotions, we all got spots
Please believe me, I still do care
Please believe me, I'm just not there
Please believe me, I'm just fair
I wanna please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
Please believe me
I wanna please believe me
Please believe me
I'm still here
I'm swept
It's true darling, I'll walk you home
I'll be your date forever
I love you girl, I love you
Until they split the atom
So many times, there's nothing left
There's nothing left at all
I know I'm right 'cause when you're gone
There's nothing left at all
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right
Left right, oh
Salute
It's so obvious
It's here, it's there
It's not just the colour
It must be more
At least seventeen and three score
This is '77
Nearly heaven
It's black, white, and pink
Just think
There's more to come
Hum hum hum hum
It's so obvious
Well, it's alright, just listen
Can't wait for '78
God those RPM
Can't wait for them
Don't just watch
Hours happen
Get in there kid and
Snap them
Sitting in a surgeon's world, a surgeon's will
A surgeon's girl with me
Standing on a river bed, where weeds can be
I'm on my knee, to you
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me
Said you weren't a tuna fish, put in a tin
They're very big, ha ha
I've seen in glossy mags
I've seen you and you see me
I've seen you and you see me
I was sold up the river to the red slave trade
The stores were gathered, the plans were laid
Synchronised watches at 18:05
How many dead or alive in 1955?
The pink flags were screaming
Bugle boys sucked and blew
No time for confessions, orders given
Books were cooked, on the fourth of the third
How many seen or heard on the twelfth of the third?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many dead or alive?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
How many, how many?
Yeah
My mind is unwilling and your flesh is so weak
Do my movements betray the secrets I think
I always stand by walls and try to humour fools
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Am I moving in a straight line?
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
Oh, it's unlust and the one dimensional boy
If he had a room, he'd paint it white
Avoids the day, prefers the night
Build sight
Got a head for figures
No time for bickerers, or so he says
Prefers the company of a woman
One, two, three, four
Finds it more physical
That's the important word
Always seen first then heard
Such a rare bird
With praise, he glows
With change, he grows
Finds that important, hates waiting
It's not stimulating, likes celebrating
I can't understand why that is so funny
That is sex
I'm tired of being told what to think
I'm tired of being told what to do
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit, all right
You can take your fucking money and shove it up your arse
'Cause you think you understand, well it's a fucking farce
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
All right no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit, ow
And if you turn and walk out that door
And take your fucking money, let me tell you what it's for
I'm tired of fucking phonies, that's right, I'm tired of you
All right, no, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
No, no, no, no, no, no, Mr. Suit
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh
Deep end, deep end
There's something going down that wasn't here before
Keep your eyes glued to the floor
No one's gonna save your life
There's something going on that's not quite right, uh-huh
There's something strange going on tonight
There's something going on that's not quite right
Joey's nervous and the lights are bright
There's something going on that's not quite right
There's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something, there's something
There's something
Tears fall in slivers, you broke my shades
The light too bright, let me bury my heart
Filter emotions of green, cowardicee gives blue
A restricted view, let me open my heart
I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile
You eat my energy, give me more rope
Nail in the wall, let me hang my heart
I have a fleeting love
Searching when it lands
Fragile, needing precious hands
Fragile
Well, you're a waste of space
No natural grace
You're so bloody thin
You don't even begin
To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
It's just you don't interest me
You're an energy void
A black hole to avoid
No style, no heart
You don't even start
To interest me
Not even curiosity
It's not animosity
It's just you don't interest me
Oh, come on
You disgrace
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Last time now
Tell me
Why don't you tell me?
Well, I wonder what's going on
Same old stuff suppose
Not quite right that
The stuff's the same but seems different to me
Seems like the cancer in the city has got to be terminal
I haven't got it through
Incidentally, where are you?
Thought you lived here
The bright lights have got you
I'd rather be a sprat than a mackerel
You can slip through the net
It's set
It also takes one to catch one
The race of champions, the pace, the pace
The speed the need, the need to seed
The chance to die
Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
You've still got speed, you'll maybe bleed
But that's next time
Less time than before, more speed than before
You're rich not poor, what are you doing it for?
Want more, want more
Another dead don't cry, another dead don't cry
Indeed it's speed, to feed from speed
Doing it all the time
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?
Maybe I should try it now
Or maybe I should be shy of it now, now, now, now, now
'Cause there's nothing you know that can explain it
And there's nothing you know that's worth the pain of it
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't work out no how?
What is this feeling called love?
What is this crazy scene I can't understand no how?
Gimme love
Gimme love
Gimme love, love, love, love, love, love
Love, love, love, love
Alright
Here it is, again
And it's called
1 2 X U
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man yeah
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man
Smoking a fag, kissing a man
Saw you in a mag, kissing a man yeah
Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, got you in a corner
Got you in a cottage, got you in a corner
Got you in a corner, oh no no no
1 2 X U
Mist closing in, getting thicker
One drops out, becoming quicker
Lights grow dim, they glimmer
The chances smaller, the odds are slimmer
Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...
Loosening my grip
Be sure to tread carefully
Steering a passage
Finding a line
Cross to comply, crossply
Progressive acceleration, skidding but the expression
Remains pan, radiators for all
Radial, I'm still in control
I understand, a hand, a hand moved me
Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...
Driven by self-propulsion
Turning right across the stream
The risks increased with sustained leisure
Courting death, so ill at...ease
Dot dash...
Dip flash...
Don't crash...
If you keep on repeating
Repeating a word
It becomes increasing
Increasingly absurd
So loving
I'm intending to
Pretending
I thought I was in
But now I'm trying to get out
I'm learning the twist
Ignoring the shouts
SO ADOR eye eyeing
I'm enquiring
Perspiring
My options are open
And it's up to me
Things are so trying
So trying for me
SO TIR eye eyeing
I'm spying something
SO TIR eye eyeing
I'm spying something
Someone clean to chew on
A wife that no one likes
I called and they said all of New York
Was a tow-away zone
We paid sixty dollars on 12th Street today
And now all our money's gone
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not
You hate my older sister
And you burglarize her home
Your dirty invitation waits
Run over on my street
I don't care who you don't like
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not
Someone clean to chew on
A wife that no one likes
I called and they said all of New York
Was a tow-away zone
We paid sixty dollars on 12th Street today
And now all our money's gone
You don't have to answer me
You don't have to call me back
Your phone's off the hook
But you're not
But you're not
But you're not
But you're not
He bought a sterilized hypo
To shoot a sex machine drug
He got twenty-four hours
To shoot all Paulenes between the legs
Ninety-six tears through twenty-four hours
Sexed once every hour
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
L.A. bus doors open
Kicking both doors open
When it rested on 6th Street
That's when he drug a girl inside
He was spreading her legs
And didn't understand dying
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
When he was waking up
Beside the bed
He found clumps of hair
The last Paulene wouldn't cooperate
She wasn't what you call living, really
She was still awake
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Johnny hit and run Paulene
Well, the clock says it's time to close now
I guess I'd better go now
I wouldn't wanna stay here all night
The cars crawl past, all stuffed with eyes
Street lights share their hollow glow
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise
Still one place to go
Still one place to go
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets
I light another cigarette
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Learn to forget
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby
Stumblin' in the neon groves
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets
Speak in secret alphabets

Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen
Warm my mind on your gentle stove
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby

Today, you're gonna be so sick, so sick
You'll prop your forehead on the sink
Say, "Oh, Christ, oh, Jesus Christ
My head's gonna crack like a bank."
Tonight, you'll fall asleep in clothes
So late like a candy bar wrapped up
For lunch, that's all you get to taste
Poverty and spit
Poverty and spit
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
Today, you're gonna be so sick, so sick
You'll prop your forehead on the sink
Say, "Oh, Christ, oh, Jesus Christ

For lunch, that's all you get to taste
Poverty and spit
Spit, spit
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
Talking out of harmony
You can't remember what you said
Cut it out, you feel retarded
Take the scissors, saw the head
Talking out of harmony
Can't remember what you said
Cut it out, you feel retarded
Take the scissors, saw the head
Nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to nausea
Bloody red eyes go to sleep
Sugarlight, we're addicts
Why do you think we came?
He's pasting gold leeches on my arm
We sharpen up our teeth
White sugar, he speaks French
Memorizing torsos
He's open-throated
In the corner
Hands arrive at hands
My arm is tied off, waiting
To burn it down
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
Sugarlight, sugarlight, I can't believe
Swallowing one bulb after another
In the city of electric light
She had to leave Los Angeles
All her toys wore out in black and her boys had too
She started to hate every nigger and Jew
Every Mexican that gave her a lotta shit
Every homosexual and the idle rich
She had to get out (get out!)
Get out (get out!)
Get out (get out!)
She gets confused
Flying over the date-line
Her hands turn red
'Cause the days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
She had to leave Los Angeles
She found it hard to say goodbye to her own best friend
She bought a clock on Hollywood Boulevard the day she left
It felt sad
It felt sad
It felt sad
She had to get out (get out!)
Get out (get out!)
Get out (get out!)
She gets confused
Flying over the date-line
Her hands turn red
'Cause the days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
The days change at night
Change in an instant
You start it out that way
You'd do anything to stay
And keep your money, boys
Made of silver and gold
And keep your Pekingese
Turkish cigarettes
And your lighter that looks just like a gun
So you married your daddy
With a different name
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in a high society
That pretty man of yours
Hiding inside the director's clothes
The one who calls you dear
After banging away at you in the night
That one's just got to go
Every time you look at him
You could almost fall asleep
And there's a masturbating
Getting underneath your belt
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in a high society
And now you tell the maid
To burn you on your virgin back
With a curling iron
Hotter than hot!
You say it's good enough
You say it's good enough
You say it's good enough
You say your pain is better
Than any kind of love
That's sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in high society
Sex and dying in a high society
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
We set the trash on fire
And watch outside the door
Men come up the pavement under the marquee
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords
On the car radio
No hard chords
On the car radio
Friends warehouse pain
Attack their own kind
A thousand kids bury their parents
There's laughing outside
We're locked out of the public eye
Some smooth chords

No one is united
And all things are untied
Perhaps we're boiling over inside
They've been telling lies
Who's been telling lies?
There are no angels
There are devils in many ways
Take it like a man
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
You can't take it back
Pull it out of the fire
Pull it out in the bottom of the ninth
Pull it out in chords of red disease
Drag on the system
Drag on my head and body
Some facts here (some facts here!)
Which refuse to escape
I could say it stronger
But it's too much trouble
I was wandering down at the bricks
Hectic, isn't it?
Down we go, cradle and all
No one is united
And all things are untied
Perhaps we're boiling over inside
They've been telling lies
Who's been telling lies?
There are no angels
There are devils in many ways
Take it like a man
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Go to hell, see if you like it, then come home with me!)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Tomorrow night may be too late)
(Both moons are full like a lovely wife)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Dirty night dying like a lovely wife)
(Goodbye, my darling!)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(How high the moon? Well, I wish I was.)
(The world is fine, goodbye, my darling!)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
(Both moons are full like a lovely wife)
(Dirty night dying like a lovely wife)
(Goodbye, my darling!)
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
The world's a mess; it's in my kiss
Art-i-ficial
I know I'm artificial
But don't put the blame on me
I was reared with appliances
In a consumer society
When I put on my make-up
The pretty little mask not me
That's the way a girl should be
In a consumer society
In a consumer society
In a consumer society
My existence is elusive
The kind that is supported

Behind his serville innocence
He plots and he schemes

It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
The hades ladies are dressed to kill
Dagger glares from Richard Hell
Tension heightening heating frightening
Thunder rolls as fast as lightening
If you've got the urge
Come on, let's submerge
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down

And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground
We're going down, we're going down
To the underground
The subterranean is a bottomless pit
The vinyl vultures are after it
Moulten lava, sulphur vapours
Smoulder on to obligerate us
If you've got the urge
Come on, let's submerge
It's dark and eerie
And it's really late
Come on kids don't hesitate
We're going down to the underground

Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
When you look in the mirror
Do you see yourself
Do you see yourself
On the T.V. screen
Do you see yourself in the magazine
When you see yourself
Does it make you scream
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
When you look in the mirror
Do you smash it quick
Do you take the glass
And slash your wrists
Did you do it for fame
Did you do it in a fit
Did you do it before
You read about it
Identity is the crisis can't you see
Identity identity
Genetic engineering
Could create the perfect race
Could create an unknown life-force
That could us exterminate
Introducing worker clone
As our subordinated slave
His expertise proficiency
Will surely dig our grave
It's so very tempting
Will biologists resist?
When he becomes the creator?
Will he let us exist?
Bionic man is jumping
Through the television set
He's about to materialise
And guess who's coming next
Genetic engineering
Could create the perfect race

I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
The cat eats the rat
While the pimp beats the whore
As she just screams out
For more and more
See we gotta be exploited
See we gotta be exploited
By somebody, by somebody, by somebody
La la la
I live off you
And you live off me
And the whole world
Lives off of everybody

I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care

Exhibition is the name
Voyeurism is the game
Stereoscopic is the show
Viewing time makes it grow
(Grow, grow, grow, gro-ow)
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
I am a poseur and I don't care
I like to make people stare
My facade is just a fake
Shock horror no escape
Sensationalism for the feed

Anti-art was the start
Establishments like a laugh
Yes we're very entertaining
Overtones can be betraying

Your deodorant smells nice
I'd like to get to know you
You're deep frozen like the ice
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way
You may get to touch her
If your gloves are sterilized
Rinse your mouth with Listerine
Blow disinfectant in her eyes
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away
The S.R. way
Her phobia is infection
She needs one to survive
It's her built-in protection
Without fear she'd give up and die
He's a germ free adolescent
Cleanliness is her obsession
Cleans her teeth ten times a day
Scrub away, scrub away, scrub away

My mind is like a plastic bag....
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
My mind is like a plastic bag
That corresponds to all those ads
It sucks up all the rubbish
That is fed in through by ear
I eat kleenex for breakfast
And I use soft hygienic Weetabix
To dry my tears
1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
My mind is like a switchboard
With crossed and tangled lines
Contented with confusion
That is plugged into my head
I don't know what's going on
It's the operators job, not mine
I said
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen to many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag
My dreams I daren't remember
Or tell you what I've seen
I dreamt that I was Hitler
The ruler of the sea
The ruler of the universe
The ruler of the supermarkets
And even fatalistic me
It's 1977 and we are going mad
It's 1977 and we've seen too many ads
It's 1977 and we're gonna show them all
Apathy's a drag!
I clambered over mounds and mounds
Of polystyrene foam
And fell into a swimming pool
Filled with fairy snow
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
I wrenched the nylon curtains back
As far as they would go
And peered through perspex window panes
At the acrylic road
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
I drove my polypropolene
Car on wheels of sponge
Then pulled into a wimpy bar
To have a rubber bun
And watched the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
The world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
The X-rays were penetrating
Through the laytex breeze
Synthetic fibre see-thru leaves
Fell from the rayon trees
The day the world turn day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know you know
The world turned day-glo
You know
Oh-oh
Searching for Mr Right
Waiting up half the night
Feeling like I'll be dead
Before I'm old
Teaching myself to be
The Young Untold
How can I hope to be
Someone for you to see?
Blind as the Fate decrees
I will go on
Teaching myself to be
The Young Untold
Am I in vain tonight?
Lose you against the light
Who can you be
Mr Right?
Re-arranging the atoms in my hairdo
Gets me thinking 'bout
Good times I had with you
Back in the Sixties when love was free
Never need to worry bout my G.C.E
Dying of boredom in your plastic home
Pretty the pictures, work to the bone
Don't be depressed
You can just pick up the phone
But it won't answer 'cos
There's no-one home
Count your possessions out one by one
Include your lovers, include the one
You threw away in nineteen sixty three
Include me out, don't label me
Staring at the mirror on
The steamy bathroom wall
Eating a Noddemix
As the people are running
The highrise starts to fall
While she neatly wipes her lips
The reporters pick up
Their pads and pens
As they rush to the scene
And the cameras wink on the gory views
How the Editors agree
Putting on her makeup
She glances at the clock
Next she'll paint her nails
The train has collided
The driver didn't stop
As she slips onto the scales
Looking for her car keys
She finds them in her shoe
Lift the magazine from the floor
That long-ago mystery
Has revealed another clue
As she quickly shuts the door
Yeah, man, they just pulled over now
And it looks like it's gonna be an all-night job tonight, you know
If you could send a few cars, it would sure help a lot
And I should sip wine in front of the TV tonight
Because there's a program I wish you to see
I'll start making a few inquiries already
Ok, that's all for now
And when I see you
Constantly changing
Never the same as, never remaining
I cannot fix you in a position
Where I would lose you out of my vision
For you are movement
And that is nothing
It's nice to hear you're having a good time
But it still hurts cause you used to be mine
This doesn't mean that I possessed you
You're haunting me because I let you
Shape up your body, let's be a tree
Visual dynamics for you to see
Nature intended the abstract for you and me
No rain outside but tears in my eyes
Out on the rooftop for a surprise
Call you at teatime
In off the street
Sit down at table, Mummy is neat
If you think the world is
A machine with one cog
And that cog is you
Or the things that you do
Then you are not in this world
The world is not you
If you think the world
Is a balloon in your head
When it goes bang only
You will be dead
'Cos you are not in this world
The world is not you
If you think the world lies
At the top of your legs
And you only live when you are in bed
Then you are not in this world
The world is your head
If you think the world is
A clutter of existence
Falling through the air
With minimal resistance
You could be right, how would I know?
Colossal youth is showing the way to go
I don't need you to love me
I don't need you to care
Take your body from by me
Be yourself over there
Though you think you adore me
Secretly you just bore me
When I'm thinking of something
You always come up nothing
Now I'm not a neurotic
Or my business spasmodic
And my only excuse is:
Everything comes from chaos
Keep your music for evenings
And your coffee for callers
Say goodbye to your freedom
Don't come here with your wallet
The Man Amplifier
Has everything but desire
Is a robot when he should
Never tires, ever good
And we're singing
Parallel sympathy with you
Skin to metal overture
Take a walk, he's always near
Like a shadow, never fear
While we're singing
Like a tower in the dark
He can leave you feeling stark
While his fingers fall away
Love is climbing in his heart
So we're singing
Take a towel to his brow
Soothe the features of the proud
Lubricate the inner man
Exercise him when you can
And be singing
Eaten out of house and home
Choci Loni starts a roam
Putting on a bandolier
Hearing through a nudie ear
Choci Loni roams
Choci Loni roams
Parrish is dancing, his feet are a blur
Comes to a standstill
I ask him a question
He doesn't hear
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Fingers are pointed in my direction
Words fly around me
Everyone's chanting
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Wurlitzer jukebox
Think of salad days
They were folly and fun
They were good, they were young
Go for credit in the straight world
Look a dealer in the eye
Go for credit in the real world
Won't you try?
I got some credit in the straight world
I lost a leg, I lost an eye
Go for credit in the real world
You won't die
Instant credit in the straight world
Leaving money when you die
Lots of credit in the real world
Gets you high
So bad when you went away
Nothing I could do or say
And now we are a lonely two
Sit at home and watch the tube
I've been hurt before
Sorrow knocking on my door
Pain
And so I make a brand-new-life
Fashioned out of brand-new strife
And when I hear the doorbell ring
I can never let them in to me
Pain is in me every day
When you went it came to stay
Come and be a cure for me
Make the tears come out of me
I've been hurt before
Sorrow knocking on my door
Pain
So bad when you went away
Nothing I could do or say
And when I hear the doorbell ring
I can never let them in to me

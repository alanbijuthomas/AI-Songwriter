Sunday morning, praise the dawning
It's just a restless feeling by my side
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's just the wasted years so close behind
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call It's nothing at all
Sunday morning and I'm falling
I've got a feeling I don't want to know
Early dawning, Sunday morning
It's all the streets you crossed, not so long ago
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call It's nothing at all
Watch out, the world's behind you
There's always someone around you who will call It's nothing at all
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
Sunday morning
I'm waiting for my man
Twenty-six dollars in my hand
Up to Lexington, 125
Feel sick and dirty, more dead than alive
I'm waiting for my man
Hey, white boy, what you doin' uptown?
Hey, white boy, you chasin' our women around?
Oh pardon me sir, it's the furthest from my mind
I'm just lookin' for a dear, dear friend of mine
I'm waiting for my man
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black
Beat up shoes and a big straw hat
He's never early, he's always late
First thing you learn is you always gotta wait I'm waiting for my man
Up to a Brownstone, up three flights of stairs
Everybody's pinned you, but nobody cares
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste
Ah then you gotta split because you got no time to waste
I'm waiting for my man
Baby don't you holler, darlin' don't you bawl and shout
I'm feeling good, you know I'm gonna work it on out
I'm feeling good, I'm feeling oh so fine
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time
I'm waiting for my man
Here she comes, you better watch your step
She's going to break your heart in two, it's true It's not hard to realize
Just look into her false colored eyes
She builds you up to just put you down, what a clown
'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks
Hear the way she talks
You're put down in her book
You're number 37, have a look
She's going to smile to make you frown, what a clown
Little boy, she's from the street
Before you start, you're already beat
She's gonna play you for a fool, yes it's true
'Cause everybody knows (She's a femme fatale)
The things she does to please (She's a femme fatale)
She's just a little tease (She's a femme fatale)
See the way she walks Hear the way she talks
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Comes in bells, your servant, don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
Downy sins of streetlight fancies
Chase the costumes she shall wear
Ermine furs adorn the imperious
Severin, Severin awaits you there
I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Kiss the boot of shiny, shiny leather
Shiny leather in the dark
Tongue of thongs, the belt that does await you
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
Severin, Severin, speak so slightly
Severin, down on your bended knee
Taste the whip, in love not given lightly
Taste the whip, now bleed for me
I am tired, I am weary
I could sleep for a thousand years
A thousand dreams that would awake me
Different colors made of tears
Shiny, shiny, shiny boots of leather
Whiplash girlchild in the dark
Severin, your servant comes in bells, please don't forsake him
Strike, dear mistress, and cure his heart
Teenage Mary said to Uncle Dave
I sold my soul, must be saved
Gonna take a walk down to Union Square
You never know who you're gonna find there
You gotta run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy Death and you
Tell you whatcha do
Marguerita Passion had to get her fix
She wasn't well, she was getting sick
Went to sell her soul, she wasn't high
Didn't know, thinks she could buy it
And she would run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy Death and you
Tell you whatcha do
Seasick Sarah had a golden nose
Hobnail boots wrapped around her toes
When she turned blue, all the angels screamed
They didn't know, they couldn't make the scene
She had to run, run, run, run, run
Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy Death and you
Tell you whatcha do
Beardless Harry, what a waste
Couldn't even get a small-town taste
Rode the trolleys down to forty-seven
Figured he was good to get himself to heaven
'Cause he had to run, run, run, run, run Take a drag or two
Run, run, run, run, run
Gypsy Death and you
Tell you whatcha do
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where
To all tomorrow's parties
And where will she go and what shall she do
When midnight comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
Why silks and linens of yesterday's gowns
To all tomorrow's parties
And what will she do with Thursday's rags When Monday comes around
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown
And cry behind the door
And what costume shall the poor girl wear
To all tomorrow's parties
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown
For whom none will go mourning
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown
Of rags and silks, a costume
Fit for one who sits and cries
For all tomorrow's parties
I don't know just where I'm going
But I'm gonna try for the kingdom, if I can
'Cause it makes me feel like I'm a man
When I put a spike into my vein
And I'll tell ya, things aren't quite the same
When I'm rushing on my run
And I feel just like Jesus' son
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know
I have made the big decision
I'm gonna try to nullify my life
'Cause when the blood begins to flow
When it shoots up the dropper's neck
When I'm closing in on death
And you can't help me now, you guys
And all you sweet girls with all your sweet talk
You can all go take a walk
And I guess that I just don't know
And I guess that I just don't know
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago
I wish that I'd sail the darkened seas
On a great big clipper ship
Going from this land here to that
In a sailor's suit and cap
Away from the big city
Where a man can not be free
Of all of the evils of this town
And of himself, and those around
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Oh, and I guess that I just don't know
Heroin, be the death of me
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life
Because a mainer to my vein
Leads to a center in my head
And then I'm better off and dead
Because when the smack begins to flow
I really don't care anymore
About all the Jim-Jim's in this town
And all the politicians makin' crazy sounds
And everybody puttin' everybody else down
And all the dead bodies piled up in mounds
'Cause when the smack begins to flow
Then I really don't care anymore
Ah, when the heroin is in my blood
And that blood is in my head
Then thank God that I'm as good as dead
Then thank your God that I'm not aware
And thank God that I just don't care
And I guess I just don't know
And I guess I just don't know
There she goes again
She's out on the streets again
She's down on her knees, my friend
But you know she'll never ask you please again
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
She won't take it from just any guy, what can you do
You see her walkin' on down the street
Look at all your friends she's gonna meet
You better hit her
There she goes again
She's knocked out on her feet again
She's down on her knees, my friend
But you know she'll never ask you please again
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she would fly, what can you do
You see her walkin' on down the street
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
You better hit her
Now take a look, there's no tears in her eyes
Like a bird, you know she will fly, fly, fly away
See her walking on down the street
Look at all your friends that she's gonna meet
She's gonna bawl and shout
She's gonna work it
She's gonna work it out, bye bye
Bye bye baby
All right
I'll be your mirror
Reflect what you are, in case you don't know
I'll be the wind, the rain and the sunset
The light on your door to show that you're home
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you
I find it hard to believe you don't know
The beauty that you are
But if you don't let me be your eyes
A hand in your darkness, so you won't be afraid
When you think the night has seen your mind
That inside you're twisted and unkind
Let me stand to show that you are blind
Please put down your hands
'Cause I see you
I'll be your mirror
The myriad choices of his fate
Set themselves out upon a plate
For him to choose
What had he to lose
Not a ghost bloodied country
All covered with sleep
Where the black angel did weep
Not an old city street in the east
Gone to choose
And wandering's brother
Walked on through the night
With his hair in his face
On a long splintered cut from the knife of G.T.
The rally man's patter ran on through the dawn
Until we said so long
To his skull-shrill yell
Shining brightly red-rimmed and
Red-lined with the time
Infused with the choice of the mind
On ice skates scraping chunks
From the bells
Cut mouth bleeding razor's
Forgetting the pain
Antiseptic remains cool goodbye
So you fly
To the cozy brown snow of the east
Gone to choose, choose again
Sacrificials remains make it hard to forget
Where you come from
The stools of your eyes
Serve to realize fame, choose again
And roverman's refrain of the sacrilege recluse
For the loss of a horse
Went the bowels and a tail of a rat
Come again, choose to go
And if Epiphany's terror reduced you to shame
Have your head bobbed and weaved
Choose a side to be on
If the stone glances off
Split didactics in two
Leave the colors of the mouse trails
Don't scream, try between
If you choose, if you choose, try to lose
For the loss of remain come and start
Start the game I che che che che I
Che che ka tak koh
Choose to choose
Choose to choose, choose to go
You killed your European son
You spit on those under twenty-one
But now your blue car's gone
You better say so long
Hey hey, bye bye bye
You made your wallpapers green
You want to make love to the scene

Waldo Jeffers had reached his limit.
It was now mid-August which meant that he had been separated from Marsha for more than two months.
Two months, and all he had to show were three dog-eared letters and two very expensive long-distance phone calls.
True, when school had ended and she'd returned to Wisconsin and he to Locust, Pennsylvania she had sworn to maintain a certain fidelity.
She would date occasionally, but merely as amusement.
She would remain faithful. But lately Waldo had begun to worry.
He had trouble sleeping at night and when he did, he had horrible dreams.
He lay awake at night, tossing and turning underneath his printed quilt protector, tears welling in his eyes,
As he pictured Marsha, her sworn vows overcome by liquor and the smooth soothings of some Neanderthal,
Finally submitting to the final caresses of sexual oblivion. It was more than the human mind could bear.
Visions of Marsha's faithlessness haunted him.
Daytime fantasies of sexual abandon permeated his thoughts.
And the thing was, they wouldn't understand who she really was.
He, Waldo, alone, understood this.
He had intuitively grasped every nook and cranny of her psyche.
He had made her smile, and she needed him, and he wasn't there. (Awww.)
The idea came to him on the Thursday before the Mummers Parade was scheduled to appear.
He had just finished mowing and edging the Edelsons lawn for a dollar-fifty
And had checked the mailbox to see if there was at least a word from Marsha.
There was nothing more than a circular form the Amalgamated Aluminum Company of America inquiring into his awning needs.
At least they cared enough to write.
It was a New York company. You could go anywhere in
the mails. Then it struck him: he didn't have enough
money to go to Wisconsin in the accepted fashion,
true, but why not mail himself? It was absurdly
simple. He would ship himself parcel post special
delivery. The next day Waldo went to the supermarket
to purchase the necessary equipment. He bought
masking tape, a staple gun and a medium sized
cardboard box, just right for a person of his build.
He judged that with a minimum of jostling he could
ride quite comfortably. A few airholes, some water, a
selection of midnight snacks, and it would probably be
as good as going tourist.
By Friday afternoon, Waldo was set. He was thoroughly
packed and the post office had agreed to pick him up
at three o'clock. He'd marked the package "FRAGILE"
and as he sat curled up inside, resting in the foam
rubber cushioning he'd thoughtfully included, he tried
to picture the look of awe and happiness on Marsha's
face as she opened the door, saw the package, tipped
the deliverer, and then opened it to see her Waldo
finally there in person. She would kiss him, and then
maybe they could see a movie. If he'd only thought of
this before. Suddenly rough hands gripped his package
and he felt himself borne up. He landed with a thud
in a truck and then he was off.
Marsha Bronson had just finished setting her hair. It
had been a very rough weekend. She had to remember
not to drink like that. Bill had been nice about it
though. After it was over he'd said that he still
respected her and, after all, it was certainly the way
of nature and even though no, he didn't love her, he
did feel an affection for her. And after all, they
were grown adults. Oh, what Bill could teach Waldo --
but that seemed many years ago. Sheila Klein, her
very, very best friend walked in through the porch
screen door into the kitchen. "Oh God, it's
absolutely maudlin outside."
"Ugh, I know what you mean, I feel all icky." Marsha
tightened the belt on her cotton robe with the silk
outer edge. Sheila ran her finger over some salt
grains on the kitchen table, licked her finger and made a face.
"I'm supposed to be taking these salt pills, but," she
wrinkled her nose, "they make me feel like throwing up."
Marsha started to pat herself under the chin, an
exercise she'd seen on television. "God, don't even
talk about that." She got up from the table and went
to the sink where she picked up a bottle of pink and
blue vitamins. "Want one? Supposed to be better than
steak." And attempted to touch her knees. "I don't
think I'll ever touch a daiquiri again." She gave up
and sat down, this time nearer the small table that
supported the telephone. "Maybe Bill'll call," she
said to Sheila's glance.
Sheila nibbled on a cuticle. "After last night, I
thought maybe you'd be through with him."
"I know what you mean. My God, he was like an
octopus. Hands all over the place." She gestured,
raising her arms upward in defense. "The thing is
after a while, you get tired of fighting with him, you
know, and after all he didn't really do anything
Friday and Saturday so I kind of owed it to him, you
know what I mean." She started to scratch. Sheila
was giggling with her hand over her mouth. "I'll tell
you, I felt the same way, and even after a while," she
bent forward in a whisper, "I wanted to," and now she
was laughing very loudly.
It was at this point that Mr. Jameson of the Clarence
Darrow Post Office rang the door bell of the large
stucco colored frame house. When Marsha Bronson
opened the door, he helped her carry the package in.
He had his yellow and his green slips of paper signed
and left with a fifteen-cent tip that Marsha had
gotten out of her mothers small beige pocket book in
the den. "What do you think it is?" Sheila asked.
Marsha stood with her arms folded behind her back. S
he stared at the brown cardboard carton that sat in
the middle of the living room. "I don't know."
Inside the package Waldo quivered with excitement as
he listened to the muffled voices. Sheila ran her
fingernail over the masking tape that ran down the
center of the carton. "Why don't you look at the
return address and see who it is from?" Waldo felt
his heart beating. He could feel the vibrating
footsteps. It would be soon.
Marsha walked around the carton and read the
ink-scratched label. "Ugh, God, it's from Waldo!"
"That schmuck," said Sheila. Waldo trembled with
expectation. "Well, you might as well open it," said
Sheila. Both of them tried to lift the stapled flap.
"Ahh, shit," said Marsha groaning. "He must have
nailed it shut." They tugged at the flap again. "My
God, you need a power drill to get this thing opened."
They pulled again. "You can't get a grip!" They
both stood still, breathing heavily.
"Why don't you get the scissors," said Sheila. Marsha
ran into the kitchen, but all she could find was a
little sewing scissor. Then she remembered that her
father kept a collection of tools in the basement.
She ran downstairs and when she came back, she had a
large sheet-metal cutter in her hand.
"This is the best I could find." She was very out of
breath. "Here, you do it. I'm gonna die." She sank
into a large fluffy couch and exhaled noisily.
Sheila tried to make a slit between the masking tape
and the end of the cardboard, but the blade was too
big and there wasn't enough room. "Godamn this
thing!" she said feeling very exasperated. Then,
smiling, "I got an idea."
"What?" said Marsha.
"Just watch," said Sheila touching her finger to her head.
Inside the package, Waldo was so transfixed with
excitement that he could barely breathe. His skin
felt prickly from the heat and he could feel his heart
beating in his throat. It would be soon. Sheila
stood quite upright and walked around to the other
side of the package. Then she sank down to her knees,
grasped the cutter by both handles, took a deep breath
and plunged the long blade through the middle of the
package, through the middle of the masking tape,
through the cardboard, through the cushioning and
(thud) right through the center of Waldo Jeffers head,
which split slightly and caused little rhythmic arcs
of red to pulsate gently in the morning sun.
Lady Godiva here dressed so demurely
Pats the head of another curly haired boy, just another toy
Sick with silence she weps sincerely
saying word that have oh so clearly been said
so long ago
Draperies wrapped gently 'round her shoulder
Life has made her that much bolder now
that she's found out how
Dressed in silk, latin lace and envy
Pride and joy of the latest penny faire
pretty passing care
Hair today now dipped in the water
Making love to every poor daughter's son
isn't it fun
Now today propping grace with envy
Lady Godiva peers to see if anyone's there
and hasn't a care
Doctor is coming the nurse thinks SWEETLY
Turning on the machines that NEATLY pump air
the body lies bare
Shaved and hairless what once was SCREAMING
now lies silent and almost SLEEPING
the brain must have gone away
Straped securly to the white table
ether caused the body to wither and writhe
underneath the white light
Doctor arrives with knife and baggage
sees the growth as just so much cabbage
that now
must be cut away
Now come the moment of Great! Great! Decision!
The doctor is making his first incision
One goes here--one goes there
The ether tube's leaking says someone who's sloppy
the patient it seems is not so well sleeping
The screams echo up the hall
Don't panic someone give him pentathol instantly
Doctor removes his blade
cagily slow from the brain
By my count of ten--
the head won't move
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Now, if she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now, now
If she ever comes now...
Ah oh, it looks so good
Ah oh, she's made out of wood
Just look and see
Oh, it's made out of wood
Just look and see now
She ever comes, she ever comes now
Now, now, now, now
She ever, ever, ever comes n-n-n-now...
Here she comes now, now
Gone, gone, gone
Ready, ready, ready, ready, ready
Got my eyes wide open
Ever since I was on cripples Monday
Got my eyeballs on my knees, Aww my baby walkin'
After hours with Mad Mary Williams
Said she never understood a word from me, because...
I know that she cares about me
I heard her call my name
And I know that she's long dead and gone
Still she ain't the same
When I wake up in the morning mama
I heard her call my name
I know that she's gone, gone, gone
I heard her call my name
And then my mind split open...
Duck and Sally inside
They're cooking for the down five
Who're staring at Miss Rayon
Who's busy licking up her big man
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
Ah, it's just like Sister Ray says
Rosy and Miss Rayon
They're busy waiting for her booster
Who just got back from Carolina
She said she didn't like the weather
They're busy waiting for her Sailor
Who said he's just as big as ever
He's just here from Alabama
He wants to know a way to earn a dollar
I'm searching for my mainline
I couldn't hit it sideways
Ah, just like Sister Ray said
Cecil's got his new piece
He cocks and shoots between three and four
He aims it at the Sailor
Shoots him down dead on the floor
Oh, you shouldn't do that
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet
Don't you know you'll stain the carpet
And by the way man, have you got a dollar
Oh no man, I haven't got the time time
Too busy sucking on a ding dong
She's too busy sucking on my ding dong
Oh, she does it just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching for my mainline
I said I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh, just like, just like Sister Ray says
Now, who's that knocking
Who's that knocking on my chamber door
Now could it be the police
They've come to take me for a ride ride
Oh, but I haven't got the time time
Too busy sucking on my ding dong
She's too busy sucking on my ding dong
Oh, now, just like Sister Ray said
I'm searching on my line
I couldn't hit it sideways
I couldn't hit it sideways
Oh now, just like, just like, just like.....
Sister Ray says.
Candy says I've come to hate my body
And all that it requires in this world
Candy says I'd like to know completely
What others so discretely talk about
I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me
Candy says I hate the quiet places
That cause the smallest taste of what will be
Candy says I hate the big decisions
That cause endless revisions in my mind
I'm gonna watch the blue birds fly over my shoulder
I'm gonna watch them pass me by
Maybe when I'm older
What do you think I'd see
If I could walk away from me
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down.
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am upside down.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
I'm going up, and I'm going down.
I'm going from side to side.
See the bells, up in the sky,
Somebody's cut their string in two.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
One minute born, one minute doomed,
One minute up, one minute down.
What goes on in your mind?
I think that I am falling down.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will work alright.
Baby, be good, do what you should, you know it will be alright.
Some kinds of love
Margarita told Tom
Between thought and expression lies a lifetime
Situations arise because of the weather
And no kinds of love
Are better than others
Some kinds of love
Margarita told Tom
Like a dirty French novel
Combines the absurd with the vulgar
And some kinds of love
The possibilities are endless
And for me to miss one
Would seem to be groundless
I head what you said
Margarita told Tom
And of course you're a bore
But at that you're not charmless
For a bore is a straight line
That finds a wealth in division
And some kinds of love
Are mistaken for vision
Put jelly on your shoulder
Let us do what you fear most
That from which you recoil
But which still makes your eyes moist
Put jelly on your shoulder
Lie down upon the carpet
Between thought and expression
Let us now kiss the culprit
I don't know just what it's all about
Put on your red pajamas and find out
Sometimes I feel so happy,
Sometimes I feel so sad.
Sometimes I feel so happy,
But mostly you just make me mad.
Baby, you just make me mad.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Thought of you as my mountain top,
Thought of you as my peak.
Thought of you as everything,
I've had but couldn't keep.
I've had but couldn't keep.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
If I could make the world as pure and strange as what I see,
I'd put you in the mirror,
I put in front of me.
I put in front of me.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Skip a life completely.
Stuff it in a cup.
She said, Money is like us in time,
It lies, but can't stand up.
Down for you is up."
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
It was good what we did yesterday.
And I'd do it once again.
The fact that you are married,
Only proves, you're my best friend.
But it's truly, truly a sin.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Linger on, your pale blue eyes.
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Jesus, help me find my proper place
Help me in my weakness
'Cos I'm falling out of grace
Jesus
Jesus

I met myself in a dream, and I just want to tell you,
Everything was alright.
Hey, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Here comes two of you.
Which one will you choose?
One is black and one is blue,
Don't know just, what to do.
Alright!
Well, I'm beginning to see the light, oh, now, here she comes!
Hey, yeah, baby, I'm beginning to see the light!
Oh-ahhhh!
Some people work very hard,
But still they never get it right.
Well, I'm begiing to see the light.
Ah, it's getting a little softer, maybe, in there.
Now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Ah, it's coming around again,
Hey, now, now, now, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
One more time.
There are problems in these times,
But, woo!, none of them are mine!
Oh, baby, I'm beginning to see the light.
Here we go again,
I thought that you were my friend.
Here we go again,
I thought that you were my friend.
How does it feel, to be loved?
How does it feel, to be loved?
I've been set free and I've been bound
To the memories of yesterday's clouds
I've been set free and I've been bound
And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
I've been blinded but
Now I can see
What in the world has happened to me
The prince of stories who walks right by me
And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
I've been set free and I've been bound
Let me tell you people
What I found
I saw my head laughing
Rolling on the ground
And now I'm set free
I'm set free
I'm set free to find a new illusion
That's the story of my life
That's the difference between wrong and right
But, Billy said, Both those words are dead
That's the story of my life
Candy screen wrappers of silkscreen fantastic
Requiring memories
Both lovely and guilt free
Lurid and lovely with twilight of ages
Luscious and lovely and filthy with laughter
Laconic giggles
Ennui fort the passions
In order to justify most spurious desires
Rectify moments
Most serious and urgent
To hail upon the face of most odious time
Requiring replies most facile and vacuous
With words nearly singed
With the heartbeat of passions
Spew forth with the grace of a tart going under
Subject of great concern
Noble origin
Please raise the flag
Rosy red carpet envy
English used here
Is messenger is nervous
It's no fun at all
Out here in the hall
For screeching and yelling and various offenses
Lower the queen and bend her over the tub
Against the state, the country, the committee
Hold her head under the water please for an hour
For groveling and spewing and various offenses
Puncture the bloat with the wing of a sparrow
The inverse, the obverse, the converse, the reverse
The sharpening wing of the edge of a sparrow
For suitable reckonings too numerous to mention
As the queen is fat she is devoured by rats
There is one way to skin a cat
Or poison a rat it is hetero
Four hear to three forthrightly stated
Put down that rag
Simpering, callow and morose
Who let you in?
If I knew, then I could get out
The murder you see
Is a mystery to me
To Rembrandt and Oswald
To peanuts and ketchup
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Up to the stand with your foot on the bible
As king I must order and constantly arouse
If you swear to catch up and throw up and up up
A king full of virgin kiss me and spin it
Excuse to willow and wander dark wonders
Divest me of robes-sutures Harry and pig meat
The fate of a nation, rests hard on your bosoms
The king on his throne, puts his hand down his robe
The torture of inverse and silk screen and Harry
And set the tongue squealing the reverse and inverse
Objections suffice
Apelike and tactile bassoon
Oboeing me
Cordon the virus' section
Off to the left
Is what is not right
Contempt, contempt and contempt for the boredom
I shall poison the city and sink it with fire
For Cordless and Harry and Apepig and Scissor
The messenger's wig seems fraught with desire
For blueberry picnics and pince-nez and magpies
The messenger's skirt, would you please hook it higher
For children and adults all those under ninety
How truly disgusting. Would you please put it down?
A stray in this fray is no condom worth saving
As king I'm quite just, but it's just quite impossible
A robe and a robe and a robe and a bat
No double class inverse could make lying worth dying
Exit the pig
Enter the Owl and Gorgeous
King on the left
It on the right and primping
Adjusting his nose
As he reads from his scroll
Off with his head
Take his head from his neck off
Requiring memories both lovely and guiltfree
Put out his eyes, then cut his nose off
Sanctimonious sycophants stir in the bushes
Scoop out his brain
Put a string where his ears were
All the king's horses and all the king's men
Swing the whole mess at the end of the wire
Scratch out his eyes with the tip of a razor
Let the wire extend from the tip of a rose
Caroline, Caroline, Caroline, Oh!
But retains the remnants of what once was a nose
Pass me my robe
Fill my bath up with water
No one knows
No nose is good news and senseless
Extend the wine
Drink here, a toast to selfless
Ten year old port
Is perfect in court
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Cascade and Cyanide, Rachaminoff, Beethoven
Skull silly wagon and justice and perverse
And reverse the inverse and inverse and inverse
Blueberry catalog, questionable earnings
Hustler's lament and the rest will in due cry
To battle and scramble and browbeat and hurt
While chewing on minstrels and choking on dirt
Disease please seems the order of the day
Please the king, please the king, please the king day
Casbah and Cascade and Rosehip and Feeling
Point of order return the king here to the ceiling
Razzamatazz
There's nothing on my shoulder
Lust is a must
Shaving my head's made me bolder
Will you kindly read
What it was I brought thee
Sick leaf and sorrow and pincers not scissors
Regard and refrain from the daughters of marriage
Regards for the elders and youngest in carriage
Regard and regard for the inverse and perverse
And obverse, and diverse, of reverse and reverse
Regard from the sick, the dumb, and the camel
From pump's storing water, like brain is to marrow
X-ray and filthy and cutting and then peeling
To skin and to skin and to bone and to structure
To livid and pallid and turgid and structured
And structured and structured and structured and structured
And regard and refrain, and regard and refrain
The sick and the dumb, inverse, reverse and perverse
Plowing while it's done away
Dumb and ready pig meat
Sick upon the carpet
Climb into the casket
Safe within the parapet
Sack is in the parapet
Pigs are out and growling
Slaughter by the seashore
See the lifeguard drowning
Sea is full of fishes
Fishes full of china
China plates are falling
All fall down
Sick and shiny carpet
Lie before my eyes-eyes
Lead me to the ceiling
Walk upon the wall-wall
Tender as the green grass
Drink the whisky horror
See the young girls dancing
Flies upon the beaches
Beaches are for sailors
Nuns across the sea-wall
Black hood horseman raging
Swordsman eating fire
Fire on the carpet
Set the house ablazing
Seize and bring it flaming
Gently to the ground-ground
Dizzy Bell Miss Fortune
Fat and full of love-juice
Drip it on the carpet
Down below the fire hose
Weep and whisky fortune
Sail me to the moon, dear
Drunken dungeon sailors
Headless Roman horsemen
The king and queen are empty
Their heads are in the outhouse
Fish upon the water
Bowl upon the saviour
Toothless wigged Laureate
Plain and full of fancy
Name upon a letterhead
Impressing all the wheat germ
Love you for a nickel
Maul you for a quarter
Set the casket flaming
Do not go gentle blazing
Denigrate obtuse and active verbs pronouns
Skewer the sieve of optical sewer
Release the handle that holds all the gates up
Puncture the eyeballs that seep all the muck up
Read all the books and the people worth reading
And still see the muck on the sky of the ceiling
Mister moonlight
Succulent smooth and gorgeous
Isn't it nice?
We're number One and so forth
Isn't it sweet
Being unique?
Relent
And obverse
And inverse
And perverse
And reverse
The inverse
Of perverse
And reverse
And reverse
And reverse
And reverse
And chop it
And pluck it
And cut it
And spit it
And sew it
To joy
On the edge
Of a cyclops
And spinet it
To rage
On the edge
Of a cylindrical minute
Dear Mister Muse
Fellow of wit and gentry
Medieval ruse
Filling the shallow and empty
Fools that duel
Duel in pools
Tantalize poets with visions of grandeur
Their faces turn blue with the reek of the compost
As the living try hard to retain what the dead lost
With double dead sickness from writing at what cost
And business
And business
And reverse
And reverse
And set the brain reeling
The inverse
And perverse
English arcane
Tantamount here to frenzy
Passing for me
Lascivious elder passion
Corpulent filth
Disguised as silk
With cheap simian melodies
Hillbilly outgush
For illiterate ramblings
For cheap understanding
For mass understanding
The simple
The inverse
The compost
The reverse
The obtuse
And stupid
And business
And business
And cheap, stupid lyrics
And simple mass reverse
While the real thing is dying
Folksy knockwurst
Peel back the skin of French and
What do you find?
Follicles intertwinning
Succulent prose
Wrapped up in robes
Jumpsuit and pig meat
And making his fortune
While making them happy
With the inverse and obverse
And making them happy
And making them happy
With the coy and the stupid
Just another dumb lackey
Who puts out one thing
While singing the other
But the real thing's alone
And it is no man's brother
Safety is nice
Not an unwise word spoken
Scary, bad dreams
Made safe in lovely songs
No doom or gloom
Allowed in this room
Oh, not to be whistled
Or studied or hummed or
Remembered at nights
When the I is alone
But to skewer and ravage
And savage and split
With the grace of a diamond, bellicose wit
To stun and to stagger with words as such stone
That those who do hear cannot again return home
Hello to Ray
Hello to Godiva and Angel
Who let you in?
Isn't it nice
The party?
Aren't the lights
Pretty at night?
Contempt, contempt, and contempt for the seething
For writhing and reeling and two-bit reportage
For sick with the body and sinister holy
The drown burst blue babies now dead on the seashore
The valorous horseman, who hang from the ceiling
The pig on the carpet, the dusty pale jissom
That has no effect for the sick with the see-saw
The inverse, obverse, converse, reverse of inverse
The diverse and converse of reverse and perverse
And sweet pyrotechnics, and let's have another
Of inverse, converse, diverse, perverse and reverse
Hell's graveyard is damned as they chew on their brains
The slick and the scum, reverse, inverse and perverse
Sick upon the staircase
Sick upon the pulpit
Blood upon the pillow
Climb into the parapet
See the church bells gleaming
Knife that scrapes a sick plate
Dentures full of air holes
The tailor couldn't mend straight
Shoot her full of air holes
Climbing up the casket
Take me to the casket
Teeth upon her red throat
Screw me in the daisies
Rip upon her holler
Snip the seas fantastic
Treat her like a sailor
Full and free and nervous
Out to make his fortune
Either this or that way
Sickly or in good health
Piss upon a building
Like a dog in training
Teach to heel or holler
Yodel on a sing song
Down upon the carpet
Tickle polyester
Sick within the parapet
Screwing for a dollar
Sucking on a fire-hose
Chewing on a rubber line
Tied to chairs and rarebits
Pay another player
Oh you're such a good lad
Here's another dollar
Tie him to the bedpost
Sick with witches' covens
Craving for a raw meat
Bones upon the metal
Sick upon the circle
Down upon the carpet
Down below the parapet
Waiting for your bidding
Pig upon the carpet
Tumenescent railroad
Neuro-anaesthesia analog
Ready for a good look
Drooling at the birches
Swinging from the birches
Succulent Nebraska
1-2-3
If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never
All the people are dancing and they're havin such fun
I wish it could happen to me
But if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
If you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the wineglass out and drink a toast to never
Oh, someday I know someone will look into my eyes
And say hello - you're my very special one
But if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
Dark cloudy bars
Shiny Cadillac cars
And the people on subways and trains
Looking gray in the rain as they stand disarrayed
All the people look well in the dark
And if you close the door, the night could last forever
Leave the sunshine out and say hello to never
All the people are dancing and they're having such fun
I wish it could happen to me
'Cause if you close the door, I'd never have to see the day again
I'd never have to see the day again
(once more)
I'd never have to see the day again

Standin' on a corner
Suitcase in my hand
Jack's in his corset, Jane is in her vest
and me I'm in a rock 'n' roll band. Huh.
Riding a Stutz Bear Cat, Jim
ya know, those were different times
all the poets studied rules of verse
and those ladies they rolled their eyes
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Now Jack, he is a banker
and Jane, she's a clerk
and both of them save their monies
when they get home from work
sittin downby the fire
Ooo, the radio does play
the classical music there, Jim
The March of the Wooden Soldiers
All you protest kids
you can hear Jack say
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Sweet Jane
Some people they like to go out dancin
and other people they have to work. Just watch me now
and there's even some evil mothers
Well there gonna tell you that everthing is just dirt
you know that women never really faint
and that villians always blink their eyes
that children are the only ones who blush
and that life is just to die
But anyone who ever had a heart
they wouldn't turn around and break it
and anyone who ever played a part
They wouldn't turn around and hate it
Sweet Jane, Sweet Sweet Jane
Jenny said when she was just five years old
You know there's nothing happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothing goin' down at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by Rock 'n' Roll
Despite all the amputations
You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station
Jenny said when she was just five years old
My parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars--
Ain't gonna help us at all
Then one fine mornin' she puts on a New York station
She don't believe what she heard at all
She started dancin' to that fine fine music
You know her life was saved by Rock 'n' Roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to a rock 'n' roll station
And it was alright.
Somebody took the papers
And somebody's got the key
And somebody nailed the door shut
That says hey what you think that you see
But me I'm down around the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E
Hey baby if you want it so fast
Don't you know that it ain't gonna last
Of course you know it makes no difference to me
Somebody's got the time time
Somebody's got the right
All of the other people
Tryin' to use up the night
But now me I'm out on the corner
You know I'm lookin' for Miss Linda Lee
Because she's got the power to love me by the hour
Gives me double you L-O-V-E
Ooh if you want it so fast
Don't you know honey you can get it so fast
But of course you know it makes no difference to me
Oh oh oh you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
Oh hey if you want it so fast
Now lookie baby don't you want it to last
But of course you know that it makes no difference to me
Oh you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
You know you'd better cool it down
Can I have your autograph?
he said to the fat blond actress
You know, I've seen every movie you've been in
from "Pass of Pain" to "Duels of Glory"
And when you kissed Robert Mitchum
Gee, but I thought you'd never catch him
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
Can I have your autograph?
he said to the fat blond actress
You know, I know everything you've done
Anyway, I hate divorces
To the left is a marble shower
It was fun even for an hour, but
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
You're over the hill right now, and you're looking for love
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
I'll come running to you, honey, when you want me
Something's got a hold on me and I don't know what
Something's got a hold on me and I don't know what
It's the beginning of a new age...
My mama told me, ever since I was seven,
Hold your head up high.
My parents toldmy ever since I was eleven,
"Hold your head up high."
They said the answer was to become a dancer,
Hold your head high.
Oh, just like I figured, they're always disfigured
With their heads up high.
Now I'm older, I'm getting so much bolder
With my head up high
Oh, as I figured, just like I figured
Since your head's up high, baby.
Oh, just like I figured,
You know, they was disfigured
Hold your head up high.
You know, they says the answer was to become a dancer
Hold your head high, boy.
Ever since I was a baby on my mama's knee,
Oh, just listened to what everybody told me,
Oh yes I did. But still the answer was to become a dancer,
And hold your head high,
But, just like I figured, they're always disfigured,
They hold their heads up high, Watch out!
Do the dog! Oh, watch out!
And now I'm older, they say I'm so much bolder
Got your head up high.
Oh, and the answer was, hey, to become a dancer,
Head up high.
Well, but just like I figured, they're always disfigured
They got their heads up high.
But the answer was, now, boy, to become a dancer
With your head up high
Head up high,
Head up high...

Train round the bend
Takin me away from my country
I'm sick of the trees
Take me to the city
Train comin' round the bend
Oh train comin' round the bend
Been in the country Oh much too long
Trying to be a farmer
But nothing that I planted never seems to grow
Train comin' round the bend
Train comin' round the bend
Hey I am just a city boy
And really not the country kind
Oh I need the city streets and I need your light
To see bend comin' round the bend
The train comin' round the bend

She's going twice
She's going to the loop up and down
She's going twice
She's going the train comin round the bend
You know the train comin round the bend
And I'm out of nowhere
Takin' me back where I belong
I've been here once and I don't take it tonight
For the train comin round the bend
The train comin round the bend
OOOh Allright!
Say a word for Jimmy Brown
He ain't got nothing at all
Not a shirt right of his back
He ain't got nothing at all
And say a word for Ginger Brown
Walks with his head down to the ground
Took the shoes right of his feet
To poor boy right out in the street
And this is what he said
Oh sweet nuthin'
She ain't got nothing at all
Oh sweet nutin'
She ain't got nothing at all
Say a word for Polly May
She can't tell the night from the day
They threw her out in the street
But just like a cat she landed on her feet
And say a word for Joanna Love
She ain't got nothing at all
'Cos everyday she falls in love
And everynight she falls when she does
She said
Oh sweet nuthin'
You know she ain't got nothing at all
Oh sweet nutin'
She ain't got nothing at all
Oh let me hear you!

Livin' in a garbage pail
My landlady call me up
She tried to hit me with a mop
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
But if Shelly she would just come back
It'll be allright
I live with thirteen dead cats
A purple who hear spats
They're all livin in a hall
And I can't stand it anymore
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Shelly she would just come back

Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why she's given half her life, to people she hates now
Stephanie says when answering the phone
What country shall I say is calling from across the world
But she's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her 'cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
Stephanie says that she wants to know
Why it is thought she's the door She can't be the room
Stephanie says but doesn't hang up the phone
What sea shell sea is calling from across the world
But she's not afraid to die, the people all call her Alaska
Between worlds so the people ask her 'cause it's all in her mind
It's all in her mind
She asks you is it good or bad
It's such an icy feeling it's so cold in Alaska,
it's so cold in Alaska, it's so cold in Alaska
She's my best friend, certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling down
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Oh, it hurts to know that you're that kinda fellow
Here's to Newspaper Joe, dropped his teeth on the floor
Caught his hand in the door
Guess that's the way the news goes
If you want to see me
Sorry, but I 'm not around
If you want to be me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is
She' my best friend, better than a dog or cat
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling down
Oh, it hurts to be that way
Oh, it hurts to know that you're that kinda fellow
Here's to Mullberry Jane, She made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet, now jelly rolls in the street
If you want to see me
Sorry, but I 'm not around
If you want to feel me
Turn around, I'm by the window where the light is
She's my best friend, certainly not the average girl
She's my best friend, understands me when I'm falling
Falling down, Falling down, ...
Lisa says that it's allright
When she meets me alone at night
Lisa says that she has a fun
And she'll do it with just about anyone.
Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Lisa says that she's on the run
Looking for a special one
Lisa says that every time she makes his trip
She knows her heart will beat
Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Looking for a part and some action
Going to make it feel okay
But what do you find
When the time has come on, now
Look at it run
Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says
Lisa says, Lisa says, Lisa says...
Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
And the waves where have they been
Silver and black lit night, here's to a stealer's night
An empty splendid castle
Glowering alone at night, the princess has had a fight
Madness seeks out a lover
And here come the waves
Down by the shore
Washing the soul of the body
That comes form the depth of the sea
Here comes the ocean
And the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
And the waves where have they been
Don't swim tonight my love, the tide is out my love
Malcolm's curse haunts our family
Odious loud and rich, ruler of filthy seas
Revel in heaven's justice
And here come the waves
And save for a scream
There's much like a song to be heard
In the wind that blows by the sea
Like the wind
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
She's over by the corner
Got her hands by her sides
They hit her harder harder harder
Till they thought she might die
Well I got a foggy notion, do it again
Over by the corner, do it again
I got my calamine lotion baby, do it again
I got a foggy notion, do it again
She made me do something that I never did before
I rushed right down to a flower store
I bought her a bundle a beautiful batch
Don't you know something, she sent 'em right back
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae, Sally Mae
Somebody shut the door
I know where temptation lies
Inside of your heart
(You can talk during this)
I know where the evil lies inside of your heart
Well, get out of here
If you're gonna try to make it right, you're surely gonna end up wrong
(Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong)
Oh, shut the door
(Ah!)
That's the only chord I know
I know where the mirror's edge is inside of your heart
Bet she didn't pay a dollar for it
I know where the razor's edge is inside of your heart
(Motown!)
It's not even five feet
Well, if you're gonna make it right, you're surely gonna end up wrong
(You don't look like Martha and the Vandellas)
Oh, she's just gonna start it all over again, somebody get her out of here
Electricity comes from other planets
(Ooh!)
(It's not that a bad solo
Four times - oh - is pretty together)
(You can't say that)
(Yes I can, I can talk to myself this way)
(I'll lock the door this time)
I know where temptation lies inside of your heart
Yes, she's ready
I know where the evil lies inside of your heart
She ready?
Well, if you're gonna try to make it right, you're surely gonna end up wrong
Oh, hold it, start again
Well, New York buildings are very high
And not at all offensive
Lock the door
Gonna carry on at infinite length, my dear
The Pope in the silver castle
Was that awful?
Hey, that's fine, that's it
One of these days
Ain't it peculiar
Gonna look for me
And baby I'll be gone
One of these days
And it won't be long
You gonna call my name
And I'll be far gone
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is if I can't stop dancing
And get my poor self off this bar room floor
One of these days
Ain't it peculiar
Babe you're gonna call my name
You now that I'll be gone (bye bye baby)
I'm gonna tell you something
That I ain't told no one before
That is if I can't stop dancing
And get my poor self off this bar room floor
One of these days
And it won't be long
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
You gonna call my name
And I'll be gone
If I could be anything in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come swooping after you
And if the last time you were here things were a bit cukoo
Well you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains bolder after you?
If I could be anyone of the things in this world that bite
Instead of an ancient ocelot on a leash, I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
And flying in the air at night
'Cause ou know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you
Yesterday, Daisy Mae and Biff were grooving on the street
And just like in a movie, her hands became her feet
Her belly button was her mouth
Which meant she tasted what she'd speak
But the funny thing is what happened to her nose
It grew until it reached all of her toes
Now when people say her feet smell they mean her nose
And curtains laced with diamonds dear for you
And all the Roman Noblemen for you
And kingdom's Christian Sailors dear for you
And melting ice cap mountain tops for you
And knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop, Swoop
Rock, Rock
Roll, Roll
Swoop, Swoop
Rock, Rock
I'm sticking with you
'Cos I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do

You held up a stagecoach in the rain
And I'm doing the same
So you're hanging from a tree
And I made believe it was me
I'm sticking with you
'Cos I'm made out of glue
Anything that you might do
I'm gonna do too
There're people going into the stratosphere
Soldiers fighting with the Cong
But with you by my side I can do anything
When we swing, babe, we hang past right and wrong
I'll do anything for you
Anything you want me too
I'll do anything for you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
Oohoh I'm sticking with you
We're gonna have a real good time together
We're gonna have a real good time together

Sha-na-na-na-na -na-na-na-na-na ...

The bar looks like haven gonna have myself a drink
Hey man don't you know I fell right in to the swing

Looking for another place
Somewhere else to be
Looking for another chance
To ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
Where everything seems so pretty
When you're lonely and tired of the city
Remember it's a flower made out of clay
To the city
Where everything seems so ugly
When your sitting at home in self pity
Remember you're just one more person
Who's living there
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city
Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple
Go and have a good time
We'll take the subway right down to King's Highway
Gonna have a good time
If it's all right it would be so nice
If you come and go with me
The roller-coaster you and me
Just try
Would you like to go on the Coney Island Steeple
Go and have a good time
Like a sister and brother we'll cling to each other
When they find out their parents aren't there
Oh it'd be so nice
Like choco with ice
Oh if you come and go with me
How nice it would be
Don't be so shy
Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday
Maybe not Friday
Saturday, Sunday
Coney Island, Coney Island, Coney Island ...

Jenny said, when she was just five years old
There was nothin' happening at all
Every time she puts on the radio
There was nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
Then, one fine mornin', she puts on a New York station
You know, she couldn't believe what she heard at all
She started shakin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Despite all the imputations
You know, you could just go out
And dance to a rock'n'roll station
And it was all right, hey baby,
You know, it was all right
Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
'You know, my parents are gonna be the death of us all
Two TV sets and two Cadillac cars
Well, you know, ain't gonna help me at all'
Then, one fine morning, she turns on a New York station
She doesn't believe what she hears at all
Ooh, she started dancin' to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yeah, rock'n'roll
Despite all the computations
You could just dance to that rock'n'roll station
And baby, it was all right, yeah
Hey, it was all right
Hey, here she comes now
Jenny said, when she was just about five years old
'Hey, you know, there's nothin' happening at all, not at all
Every time I put on the radio
You know, there's nothin' goin' down at all, not at all
But, one fine morning, she hears a New York station
She couldn't believe what she heard at all, hey, not at all
She started dancing to that fine, fine music
You know, her life was saved by rock'n'roll
Yes, rock'n'roll
Despite all the computations
You know, you could just dance to the rock'n'roll station
All right
All right, all right, and it was all right
Oh, listen to me now, it was all right
Come on now, believe me, it was all right
it was all right
Hey, it's all right now,.......
It's hard being a man
living in a garbage pail
My landlady called me up, ooohhh
she tried to hit me with a mop
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more, oh
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Candy would just come back
it'd be all right
Yeah, if Candy would just come back
it would be all right, come on baby
I live with thirteen dead cats
a purple dog that wears spats
They're all out livin' in the hall
and I can't stand it anymore
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
But if Candy would just come back
it'd be all right
Ooohhh, if Candy would just come back
it would be all right, be all right now
Ah, come on baby
I'm tired of living all alone
yeah, nobody ever calls me on the phone
But when, ah, things start getting bad, ah
I just play my music louder
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it anymore more
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, no
I can't stand it, I can't stand it, oh
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it
I can't stand it, I can't stand it

When you're in a dream
and you think you got your problems all nailed down
Pieces of the scheme
seem to rattle up and then to rattle down
And when you start to fall
and those footsteps they start to fade
Well then you know you're going down
yeah, you're falling all around
And you know you're going down
for the last time
When you're in the air
and you're thinking you'll drift off into the west
Your friends polite, advise
hey look you're pushing too hard
and perhaps you need a rest
And when you start to fall
and all those footsteps they start to fade
Then you know you're going down
yeah, you're crashing upside down
And you know you're going down
for the last -
- Time's not what it seems
it just seems longer, when you're lonely in this world
Everything it seems
would be brighter if your nights were spent with some girl
Yeah, you're falling all around
yeah, you're crashing upside down
Oh, oh, and you know you're going down
for the last time
I got hearts, ah, in my looney tunes
I got dreams and you do, too
I got ten wheel drive
to pick you up, up to your ears, oh
I got refined carbon in my eyelids, dear
I've got no one to love and no one to fear
You better walk it
and talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
and knock yourself right off of your feet
If you're moving too fast
don't you want it to last
You better walk it, talk it
you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
oh
I've got dimes in my shoes real nice
I've got bells that are laid on ice
I got dreams
let me mix it with a little gin
I got cool when I'm cold and warm when I'm hot
but me is the one thing baby, you ain't got
You got to walk it
and talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
and knock yourself right off of your feet
Yeah, if you're moving too fast
now don't you want it to last, ah
You better walk it, talk it
you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
You better walk it
and talk it less you lose that beat
You better lose yourself mama
and knock yourself right off of your feet
Yeah, if you're moving too fast
now don't you want it to last
You better walk it, talk it
you better walk it as you talk it less you lose that beat
Ah-ha-ha
oh, all right, ooohhh
Lisa says, on a night like this
it'd be so nice, if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says, honey, for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while
Lisa says
Lisa says
Lisa says, oh, no
Lisa says
Lisa says, honey, you must think -
- I'm some kind of California fool
the way you treat me just like some kind of tool
Lisa says, hey baby, if you stick your tongue in my ear
then the scene around here will become very clear
Lisa says, oh no
Lisa says, hey, don't you be a little baby
Lisa says, oh, no
Lisa says
Hey, if you're looking for a good time Charlie
well, that's not really what I am
You know, some good time Charlie
always out, having his fun
But if you're looking for some good, good lovin'
then sit yourself right over here
You know that those good, those good times
they just seem to pass me by, just like pie in the sky
And Lisa says, on a night like this
it'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says, hey baby, for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while
let me hear you now
Lisa says, oh, no, no
Lisa says, hey, don't you be a little baby
Lisa says, oh, no
Lisa says
Why am I so shy
Why am I so shy, Gee, you know those
good good times, they just seem to pass me by
Why am I so shy
First time I saw you I was talking to myself
I said, hey, you got such pretty, pretty eyes
(that pretty eyes)
Now that you're next to me I just get so upset
And Lisa, will you tell me, why am I so shy
Why am I so shy
Why am I so shy, well, you know that those
good, good times, they just seem to pass me by
Why am I so shy
And Lisa says, on a night like this
it'd be so nice if you gave me a great big kiss
And Lisa says, honey, for just one little smile
I'll sing and play for you for the longest while
Lisa says, oh, no, now
Lisa says, hey don't you be a little baby
Lisa says, oh, no
Lisa says
In Berlin, by the wall
you were five foot ten inches tall
It was very nice
candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
We were in a small cafe
you could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
it was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
Oh, you're right and I'm wrong
you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
In a small, small cafe
we could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
Don't forget, hire a vet
he hasn't had that much fun yet
It was very nice
hey honey, it was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
oh babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
You're right, oh, and I'm wrong
you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
One sweet day, one sweet day
oh, one sweet day
One sweet day, baby-baby, one sweet day
one sweet day, one sweet day
When I think of all the things I've done
and I know that it's only just begun
Those smiling faces, you know I just can't forget 'em
but I love you
When I think of all the things I've seen
and I know that it's only the beginning
You know those smiling faces, I just can't forget 'em
but for now, I love you
Just for a little while
oh baby, just to see you smile
Just for a little while
When I think of all the things I've done
and I know that it's only just begun
Oh, smiling faces, Jesus, you know I can't forget 'em
But for now, I love you
right this minute, baby now
I love you
at least for now, I love you
I was talkin' to Chuck in his Genghis Khan suit
and his wizard's hat
He spoke of his movie and how he was makin'
a new sound track
And then we spoke of kids on the coast
and different types of organic soap
And the way suicides don't leave notes
Then we spoke of Lorraine
always back to Lorraine
I was speakin' to Phil who was given to pills
and small racing cars
He had given them up since his last crack-up
had carried him too far
Then we spoke of the movies and verse
and the way an actress held her purse
And the way life at times can get worse
Then we spoke of Lorraine
always back to Lorraine
Ah, she's a wild child
and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child
oh, and nobody can get to her
Sleepin' out on the street
Oh, livin' all alone
without a house or a home
and then she asked you, please
hey, baby, can I have some spare change
Oh, can I break your heart?
She's a wild child, she's a wild child
I was talkin' to Betty about her auditions
how they made her ill
But life is the theater, is certainly fraught
with many spills and chills
But she'd come down after some wine
which is what happens most of the time
Then we sat and both spoke in rhymes
Till we spoke of Lorraine
ah, always back to Lorraine
I was talking to Ed who'd been reported dead
by mutual friends
He thought it was funny that I had no money
to spend on him
So we both shared a piece of sweet cheese
and sang of our lives and our dreams
And how things can come apart at the seams
And we talk of Lorraine
always back to Lorraine
She's a wild child
oh, and nobody can get at her
She's a wild child
oh, and nobody can get to her
Sleepin' out on the street
Oh, livin' all alone
without a house or a home
and then she asked you, please,
oh, baby, can I have some spare change
Now can I break your heart?"
She's a wild child, she's a wild child
Life isn't what is seems
I'm forever drifting into dreams
Such a sad affair
to always be drifting into air
But it's not what you say or you do
that makes me feel like I am falling
It's things that we've both been through
that makes me feel like I am upside down
And love makes you feel ten foot tall
Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall
Just a funny thing
I'm forever drifting into dreams
Huh, just not the proper thing
to always be drifting into dreams
But it's not what you say or you do
that makes me feel like I am falling
It's things that we've both been through
that makes me feel like I am upside down
And love makes you feel ten foot tall
Yes, love makes you feel ten foot tall
And it sounds like this
Looking for another chance
for someone else to be
Looking for another place
to ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
ride into the sun
Ride into the sun
ride into the sun
Where -
- everything seems so pretty
but if you're tired and you're sick of the city
Remember that it's just a flower
made out of clay
Oh-oh-oh, the city -
- where everything seems so dirty
but if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity
Remember that you're just one more
person who's there
It's hard to live in the city
It's hard to live in the city, oh, oh-oh
It's hard to live in the city, oh, wow-wow
It's hard to live in the city
Here comes the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where have they been
Don't swim tonight my love, the sea is mad my love
it's known to drive men crazy
Malcolm has burned at sea, the castle it sits and reeks
the madness can make you hazy
But here come the waves
down by the shore
Washing the rocks that have been here
centuries or more
Down by the sea
Here come the ocean
and the waves down by the sea
Here comes the ocean
and the waves where have they been
Castles glowing at night, towers above out fright
warlocks decapitating
Malcolm he lives on hate, serve your brain on a plate
feasts on your mouth for dinner
But here come the waves
down by the sea
Washing the eyes of the men
who have died
Down by the sea
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Here come the waves
Vicious, you hit me with a flower
You do it every hour
Oh, baby you're so vicious
Vicious, you want me to hit you with a stick
But all I've got is a guitar pick
Oh baby, you're so vicious
When I watch you come, baby, I just want to run far away
You're not the kind of person around I want to stay
When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hands and I mangle your feet
You're not the kind of person that I want to meet
Baby, oh you're so vicious, you're so vicious
Vicious, you hit me with a flower
You do it every hour
Oh, baby you're so vicious
Vicious, hey why don't you swallow razor blades
You must think that I'm some kind of gay blade
But baby, you're so vicious
When I see you coming I just have to run
You're not good and you certainly aren't very much fun
When I see you walking down the street
I step on your hand and I mangle your feet
You're not the kind of person that I'd even want to meet
'Cause you're so vicious, baby, you're so vicious
Vicious, vicious...
If I could be anything
in the world that flew
I would be a bat and come
swooping after you
And if the last time you were here
things were a bit askew
Well, you know what happens after dark
When rattlesnakes lose their skins and their hearts
And all the missionaries lose their bark
Oh, all the trees are calling after you
And all the venom snipers after you
Are all the mountains boulder after you
If I could be any one of the things
in this world that bite
Instead of a dentured ocelot on a leash
I'd rather be a kite
And be tied to the end of your string
and flying in the air, baby, at night
'Cause you know what they say about honey bears
When you shave off all their baby hair
You have a hairy minded pink bare bear
And all the bells are rolling out for you
And stones are all erupting out for you
And all the cheap bloodsuckers are flying after you

Oh, oh, and knights in flaming silver robes for you
And bats that with a kiss turn prince for you
Swoop, swoop, oh, baby, rock, rock
Swoop, swoop, rock, rock
Swoop, swoop, rock, rock
Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark
We go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later a movie, too
And then home
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
Harry was a rich young man
Who would become a priest
He dug up his dear father
Who was recently deceased
He did it with tarot cards
And a mystically attuned mind
And shortly therein
After he did find
Jeanie was a spoiled young brat
She thought she knew it all
She smoked mentholated cigarettes
And she had sex in the hall
But she was not my kind
Or even of my sign
The kind of animal
That I would be about
Woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
Oh-woh-woh-woh, you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
All right now
Ah-huh-huh
Kathy was a bit surreal
She painted all her toes
And on her face she wore dentures
Clamped tightly to her nose
And when she finally spoke
Her twang her glasses broke
And no one else could smoke
While she was in the room
Hark the herald angels sang
And reached out for a phone
And plucking it with a knife in hand
Dialed long distance home
But it was all too much
Sprinkling angel dust
To AT and T
Who didn't wish you well
Oh, but you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
Ho-ho-ho-ho, you keep hangin' round me
And I'm not so glad you found me
You're still doing things that I gave up years ago
Hangin' round
Hangin' round, that's all you're doing baby
Hangin' round
Hangin' round, ooohhh
Hangin' round
Hangin' round
Hangin' round
Hangin' round
...
Holly came from Miami, F.L.A.
Hitch-hiked her way across the U.S.A.
Plucked her eyebrows on the way
Shaved her legs and then he was a she
She says, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
Said, "Hey, honey,
Take a walk on the wild side."
Candy came from out on the Island
In the back room she was everybody's darling
But she never lost her head
Even when she was giving head
She says, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
Said, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
And the colored girls go
"Doo do doo do doo do do doo..."
Little Joe never once gave it away
Everybody had to pay and pay
A hustle here and a hustle there
New York City's the place
Where they said, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
I said, "Hey, Joe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
Sugar Plum Fairy came and hit the streets
Looking for soul food and a place to eat
Went to the Apollo
You should've seen them go, go, go
They said, "Hey, sugar,
Take a walk on the wild side."
I said, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
All right, huh
Jackie is just speeding away
Thought she was James Dean for a day
Then I guess she had to crash
Valium would have helped that bash
Said, "Hey, babe,
Take a walk on the wild side."
I said, "Hey, honey,
Take a walk on the wild side."
And the colored girls say,
"Doo do doo do doo do do doo..."
Your face when sleeping is sublime
And then you open up your eyes
Then comes pancake factor number one
eyeliner, rose hips and lip gloss, such fun
You're a slick little girl
you're a slick little girl
Rouge and coloring, incense and ice
perfume and kisses, ooohhh, it's all so nice
You're a slick little girl
you're such a slick little girl
Now, we're coming out
out of our closets
Out on the streets
yeah, we're coming out
When you're in bed it's so wonderful
it'd be so nice to fall in love
When you get dressed I really get my fill
people say that it's impossible
Gowns lovely made out of lace
and all the things that you do to your face
You're a slick little girl
oh, you're a slick little girl
Eyeliner, whitener then color the eyes
yellow and green, ooohhh, what a surprise
You're a slick little girl
oh, you're such a slick little girl
Now, we're coming out
out of our closets
Out on the streets
yes, we're coming out
Yeah, we're coming out
yeah, we're coming out

Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me, baby, how do you feel
Yeah, you got to live, yeah, your life
as though you're number one
Yeah, you got to live, yeah, your life
and make a point of having some fun
But if you think
that you get kicks from flirting with danger
Danger, ooohhh
just kick her in head and rearrange her
Oh, heavenly father, what can I do
what she's done to me is making me crazy
Oh, heavenly father, I know I have sinned
but look where I've been, it's making me lazy
Won't you be my wagon wheel
Won't you tell me, baby, how does you feel
You got to live, yeah, your life
as though you're number one
Yeah, you got to live, yeah, your life
and make a point of having some fun
But if you think
that you get kicks from flirting with danger
Danger, ooohhh

And then why don't you wake me, shake me
please don't you let me sleep too long
Why don't you wake me, shake me

Don't wanna miss it now, wake me, shake me, baby

I was sleeping, gently napping
when I heard the phone
Who is on the other end talking
am I even home
Did you see what she did to him
did you hear what they said
Just a New York conversation
rattling in my head
Oh, oh, my, and what shall we wear
Oh, oh, my, and who really cares
Just a New York conversation
gossip all of the time
Did you hear who did what to whom
happens all the time
Who has touched and who has dabbled
here in the city of shows
Openings, closings, bad repartee
everybody knows
Oh, how sad and why do we call
Oh, I'm glad to hear from you all
I am calling, yes I am calling
just to speak to you
For I know this night will kill me
if I can't be with you
If I can't be with you
Yes I am mother nature's son
and I'm the only one
I do what I want and I want what I see
huh, could only happen to me
I'm so free
I'm so free
Oh, please, Saint Germaine
I have come this way
Do you remember the shape I was in
I had horns that bent
I'm so free
I'm so free
Do you remember the silver walks
you used to shiver and I used to talk
Then we went down to Times Square
and ever since I've been hanging around there
I'm so free
I'm so free
Yes I am mother nature's son
and I'm the only one
I do what I want and I want what I see
could only happen to me
I'm so free
I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
early in the morning, I'm so free
Late in the evening, I'm so free
yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
When I feel good, I'm so free
when it's in the morning, I'm so free
When it's in the evening, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
feel so good, now, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free
feel so good, now, I'm so free
Feel little nice, I'm so free
feel little down, now, I'm so free
You're so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free
I'm so free, I'm so free

Oh, I'm still missing my other half
oh, it must be something I did in the past
Don't it just make you wanna laugh
it's a lonely Saturday night
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone
I put another record on my stereo
But I'm still singing a song of you
it's a lonely Saturday night
Now, if I was an actor
or a dancer who is glamorous
then, you know, amorous life would soon be mine
But now the tinsel light of star break
is all that's left to applaud my heart break
and eleven o'clock I watch the network news
Oh, woh, woh, something tells me that you're really gone
you said we could be friends
but that's not what's not what I want
Ah, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done
it's a lonely Saturday night
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night
One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night
In Berlin, by the wall
you were five foot ten inches tall
It was very nice
candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
We were in a small cafe
you could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
it was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
Oh, you're right and I'm wrong
you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
In a small, small cafe
we could hear the guitars play
It was very nice
candlelight and Dubonnet on ice
Don't forget, hire a vet
he hasn't had that much fun yet
It was very nice
hey honey, it was paradise
You're right and I'm wrong
oh babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
You're right, oh, and I'm wrong
you know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone
One sweet day
One sweet day
One sweet day, one sweet day
oh, one sweet day
One sweet day, baby-baby, one sweet day
one sweet day, one sweet day
When she walked on down the street
She was like a child staring at her feet
But when she passed the bar
and she heard the music play
She had to go in and sing
it had to be that way
She had to go in and sing
it had to be that way
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
After the applause had died down
And the people drifted away
She climbed down off the bar
and went out the door
To the hotel
that she called home
It had greenish walls
a bathroom in the hall
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no
oh, Lady Day
And I said no, no, no

Men of good fortune
often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings
often can't do anything at all
The rich son waits for his father to die
the poor just drink and cry
And me, I just don't care at all
Men of good fortune
very often can't do a thing
While men of poor beginnings
often can do anything
At heart they try to act like a man
handle things the best way they can
They have no rich, daddy to fall back on
Men of good fortune
often cause empires to fall
While men of poor beginnings
often can't do anything at all
It takes money to make money they say
look at the Fords, but didn't they start that way
Anyway, it makes no difference to me
Men of good fortune
often wish that they could die
While men of poor beginnings
want what they have and to get it they'll die
All those great things that live has to give
they wanna have money and live
But me, I just don't care at all
Men of good fortune
men of poor beginnings
Men of good fortune
men of poor beginnings
Men of good fortune
men of poor beginnings
Men of good fortune
men of poor beginnings

Caroline says that I'm just a toy
she wants a man, not just a boy
Oh, Caroline says, ooohhh, Caroline says
Caroline says she can't help but be mean
or cruel, or oh so it seems
Oh, Caroline says, Caroline says
She say she doesn't want a man who leans
Still she is my Germanic -
- Queen
Yeah, she's my Queen
The things she does, the things she says
people shouldn't treat others that way
But at first I thought I could take it all
Just like poison in a vial
hey, she was often very vile
But of course, I thought I could take it all
Caroline says that I'm not a man
so she'll go get it catch as catch can
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says
Caroline says moments in time
can't continue to be only mine
Oh, Caroline says, yeah, Caroline says
She treats me like I am a fool
But to me she's still a German -
- Queen, ooohhh, she's my -
- Queen, ya ...
Queen, hey baby, she's my Queen

How do you think it feels
when you're speeding and lonely, come here baby
How do you think it feels
when all you can say is if only
If only I had a little
if only I had some change, come here baby
If only, if only, if only
How do you think it feels
and when do you think it stops
How do you think it feels
when you've been up for five days, come down here mama
Hunting around always, ooohhh
'cause you're afraid of sleeping
How do you think it feels
to feel like a wolf and foxy
How do you think it feels
To always make love by proxy, huh
how do you think it feels
And when do you think it stops
when do you think it stops
All your two-bit friends
They're shootin' you up with pills
They said that it was good for you
That it would cure your ills
I don't care just where it's at
I'm just like an alley cat
And when you're filled up to here with hate
Don't you know you gotta get it straight
Filled up to here with hate
Beat her black and blue and get it straight
Do, do, do, do, do, do
When you're lookin' through the eyes of hate
All your two-bit friends
They asked you for your autograph
They put you on the stage
They thought it'd be good for a laugh
But I don't care just where it's at
'Cause honey, I'm just like an alley cat
And when you're filled up to here with hate
Don't you know you gotta get it straight
Filled up to here with hate
Beat her black and blue and get it straight
Uh-huh
Oh, Jim
How could you treat me this way
Hey, hey, hey
How could you treat me this way
Oh, Jim
How could you treat me this way
Hey, hey
How could you treat me this way
You know you broke my heart
Ever since you went away
Now you said that you love us
But you only make love to one of us
Oh, oh, oh, oh, Jim
How could you treat me this way
You know you broke my heart
Ever since you went away
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
When you're looking through the eyes of hate
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Caroline says
as she gets up off the floor
Why is it that you beat me
it isn't any fun
Caroline says
as she makes up her eyes
You ought to learn more about yourself
think more than just I
But she's not afraid to die
all her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
what is in her mind
Caroline says
as she gets up from the floor
You can hit me all you want to
but I don't love you anymore
Caroline says
while biting her lip
Life is meant to be more than this
and this is a bum trip
But she's not afraid to die
all her friends call her "Alaska"
When she takes speed, they laugh and ask her
What is in her mind
what is in her mind
She put her fist through the window pane
It was such a funny feeling
It's so cold in Alaska
it's so cold in Alaska
It's so cold in Alaska
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because she was making it with sisters and brothers
And everyone else, all of the others
Like cheap officers who would stand there and flirt in front of me
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things that they heard she had done
The black Air Force sergeant was not the first one
And all of the drugs she took, every one, every one
And I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because number on was the girl friend from Paris
The things that they did - ah - they didn't have to ask us
And then the Welshman from India, who came here to stay
They're taking her children away
Because they said she was not a good mother
They're taking her children away
Because of the things she did in the streets
In the alleys and bars, no she couldn't be beat
That miserable rotten slut couldn't turn anyone away
I am the Water Boy, the real game's not over here
But my heart is overflowin' anyway
I'm just a tired man, no words to say
But since she lost her daughter
It's her eyes that fill with water
And I am much happier this way
This is the place where she lay her head
when she went to bed at night
And this is the place our children were conceived
candles lit the room brightly at night
And this is the place where she cut her wrists
that odd and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
This is the place where we used to live
I paid for it with love and blood
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf
Filled with her poetry and stuff
And this is the room where she took the razor
and cut her wrists that strange and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
I never would have started if I'd known
that it'd end this way
But funny thing, I'm not at all sad
that it stopped this way
This is the place where she lay her head
when she went to bed at night
And this is the place our children were conceived
candles lit the room brightly at night
And this is the place where she cut her wrists
That odd and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
Staring at my picture book
she looks like Mary, Queen of Scots
She seemed very regal to me
just goes to show how wrong you can be
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
My castle, kids and home
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots
I tried so very hard
shows just how wrong you can be
I'm gonna stop wasting time
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song
Sad song, sad song

Sit yourself down
bang out a tune on that grand piano
Sit yourself down
lay languidly down upon that sofa
Ooohhh, isn't it nice
when your heart is made out of ice
Ride, Sally, ride
it's not your time or way of confusion
Ride, Sally, ride
'cause if you don't, you'll get a contusion
Ooohhh, isn't it nice
when your heart is made out of ice
Sit yourself down
take off your pants, don't you know this is a party
Sit yourself down
why do you think we brought all these people, Miss Brandy
Ooohhh, isn't it nice
when you find your heart's made out of ice
Ride, Sally, ride
it's not your time, it's just your confusion
Ride, Sally, ride
it's not your time, you'll get a contusion
Ooohhh, isn't it nice
when you find your heart is made out of ice
(Ride, Sally ride)
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Ride, Sally, ride
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Hey, ride, Sally, ride

Miss Riley had a dog
she used to keep it in her backyard
And when the dog began to bark
all the neighbors began to shout
Then came a stormy night
Miss Riley let her dog out
And when the neighbors found him 'round
they put a gun down his mouth and shot him down
and he went
Ooohhh-wow, bow-wow
Ooohhh-wow, bow-wow
Miss Murphy had a cat
on her lap it sat
And once in a great big while
it looked like that Cheshire cat did smile
But often it used to chase
anything that crossed its face
But one day it got so hot
that Cheshire cat had a blood clot
and she said
Ooohhh-meow, me-meow
Ooohhh-meow, me-meow
Meow
And then the dog met the cat
the dog was hot and the cat was wet
Then came some sweaty dude
he put a board between the two
Then they couldn't get at it
got frustrated all about it
So they did the only thing you could do
they took the dude's sweat and shot it up between the two
and they said
Ooohhh-wow, bow-wow
Ooohhh-wow, bow, me, wow
Jim, livin' with you'd not such fun
You're not the only one
You don't have the looks
you're not the person that you used to be
And there are people on the street that would go for me
And I said, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
And I said, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
I met you in a bar in L.A.
I was not feeling so good
You did the proper moves
you did everything that you should
But now you're making a mistake
and somebody else will take your place
You're taking drugs off of me
And I said, no, no, no, no, no
I said now, no, no, no, no, no
I said now, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
I said, now, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
You're not the kind of person
it's easy to live with in a house
I cook all your meals
I make sure that you work out
But lately it's been gettin' so hard
(man, you don't split your stash with your blood)
the way you talk, ooohhh, the way you walk
(you can keep it)
And I'm not sure exactly what it's all about
And I said, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
I said, now, no, no, no, no, no
baby face
I said now, no, no, no, no
I said now, no, no, no, no
ooohhh, baby face, ohh
No, no, baby face
No way, no, baby face
uh, uh
(you can keep it, just keep it)
The stock is empty
in our eyeball store
All we got left
a few cataracts and sores
The faggot mimic machine
never had ideas
Mission impossible
they self destruct on fear
On a standard New York night
ghouls go to see their so called stars
A fairly stupid thing
to pay 5 bucks for a 4th rate imitators
They say, I'm so empty
no surface, no depth
Oh, please, can I be you
your personality's so great
Like new buildings
square tall and the same
Sorry, Miss Stupid
didn't you know it was a game
I'm just waiting
for them to hurry up and die
It's really getting to crowed here
help me New York stars
Contributions accepted all the same
We need new people store
remember, we're very good at games
All your two-bit psychiatrists
are giving you electroshock
They said, they'd let you live at home with mom and dad
instead of mental hospitals
But every time you tried to read a book
you couldn't get to page 17
'Cause you forgot where you were
so you couldn't even read
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
don't you know gonna kill, kill your sons
They're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
Mom informed me on the phone
she didn't know what to do about dad
Took an axe and broke the table
aren't you glad you're married
And sister, she got married on the island
and her husband takes the train
He's big and he's fat
and he doesn't even have a brain
They're gonna kill your sons
don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run away
Creedmore treated me very good
but Paine Whitney was even better
And when I flipped out on PHC
I was so sad, I didn't even get a letter
All of the drugs, that we took
it really was lots of fun
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke
you choke like a son of a gun
Don't you know they're gonna kill your sons
don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
Don't you know they're gonna kill, kill your sons
until they run, run, run, run, run, run, run away
All the things you said
you thought I was dead
everything made me feel aware
Ah, you're getting old
you're doing things
you're losing your hair
All the things that you used to believe in
Turned out to be true, you're guilty of reason
You're the kind of person that
I could do without
And certain kinds of money would make you see
what it's all about
There's a first time for everything
And a first one's on me, don't you see
All of the things that your old lover said
look at them, they jump out of windows
and now they're just dead
It's the truth, don't you realize
Faded without any talent of fun
running out on the streets, balling anyone
It's the truth, It's the truth
Pick up the pieces that make up your life
maybe some day you'll have a wife and them alimony
Oh, can't you see
Sally dances on the floor
she says that she can't do it anymore
She walks down St. Marks Place
and eats natural food at my place
Now Sally can't dance no more
she can't get off of the floor
Sally can't dance no more
they found her in the trunk of a Ford
ooohhh, she can't dance no more
Sally is loosing her face
she lives on St. Marks Place
In a rent-controlled apartment, eighty dollars a month
she has lots of fun, she has lots of fun, but
Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
Sally can't dance no more
She took too much meth and can't get off the floor
now Sally, she can't dance no more
She was the first girl in the neighborhood
to wear tied-dyed pants, ah, like she should
She was the first girl that I ever seen
that had flowers painted on her jeans
She was the first girl in her neighborhood
who got raped on Tompkins Square, real good
Now she wears a sword, like Napoleon
and she kills the boys and acts like a son
Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh, now
Sally can't dance no more
She can't get herself off the floor, ah, huh
Sally, ooohhh, she can't dance no more
Watch this, now
Sally became a big model
she moved up to eighties and park
She had a studio apartment
and that's where she used to ball, folk singers
and that's where she used to ball, folk singers, but
Sally, she can't dance no more
Sally, she can't dance no more
Sally can't get herself off of the floor
now, Sally, she can't dance no more
(Sally can't dance)
(Sally can't dance)
She knew all the really right people
she went to Le Jardin
She danced with Picasso's illegitimate mistress
and wore Kenneth Lane jewels, really it's trash, but
Sally can't dance no more, ooohhh
Sally can't dance no more

Billy was a good friend of mine
We grew up together ever since we were nine
We went to school, he was my best friend
And I thought our friendship would never end
In high school he played football
And me, I didn't do anything at all
He made touch-downs, while I played pool
And no one could figure out which one of us was the fool
Then we both went to collage
He studied medicine while I studied foliage
He got A's and I got D's
He was going for his Ph.D.
Then I decided to drop out
Things were getting a little too hot
Billy stayed there, became an intern and then a doctor
Then war broke out and he had to go
But not me, I was mentally unfit, or so they say, so, so
When he came back, he wasn't quite the same
His nerves were shot, but not me
Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore
He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door
Billy was a friend of mine
I grew up with him ever since I was nine
We went together through school
And now I often wonder, which one of us was the fool
You're makin' a fool out of yourself
By following me around
Like a Japanese woman who stands ten steps in the shadow of her man
You're following me around
You're following me around
You're makin' a joke of yourself
Your friends are talking behind your back
You're makin' a joke of yourself
Your friends are talking behind your back
What you gonna do
What you gonna do
Makin' a fool of yourself over me
Makin' a fool of yourself, can't you see
Makin' a fool of yourself over me
Over me, over me, over me
Proves that you have good taste
Makin' a fool of yourself
By slipping around
Shooting up (?)
Under the ground
But it just gets to prove
That you've got good taste
You've got good taste
You're the kind of person that I've been dreaming of
You're the kind of person that I always wanted to love
And when I first seen you walk right through that bar door
And I seen those suit and tie johns buy you one drink
and then buy you some more, I had a
I know you had that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
You know that I've had that crazy feeling, too
I can see it in your
You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, now, now, you got that crazy feeling
I've had that crazy feeling, too
Now everybody knows that business ends at three
And everybody knows that after hours love is free
And you, you really are a queen
oh, such a queen, such a queen
And I know, 'cause I made the same scene
I know just what you mean, because
You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
You got that crazy feeling deep inside
now, I can see it in your eyes
You got that crazy feeling
now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling
And you got that crazy feeling, too
I feel just like, feel just like you
(Crazy feeling, crazy feeling)
Everybody said that you'd better watch out
Man, she's gonna turn you in
And me, you know that I thought that I looked out
Now look at the trouble that I'm in
you know, you'd better -
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
It happened on New Year's Eve
They said everybody had to leave
They had a warrant in their hand
They wanted to bust the whole band
I said if I ever see Sharon again
I'm gonna punch her face in
you know you, you'd better -
Watch out for Charley's girl
hey, now, now
Watch out for Charley's girl
you know she'll turn you, turn you in
Watch out for Charley's girl
Watch out for Charley's girl
she'll turn you in you'd better, huhh -
Watch out, you'd better -
watch out, you'd better -
You'd better watch out, you'd better
you'd better watch out for -
Charley's girl
She's my best friend

Yeah, she's my best friend
she understands me when I'm feeling -
- Down-down-down-down-down-down
you know it sure hurts to be that way
Down-down-down-down-down-down
you know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella
Ah, here's to Mullberry Jane (here's to Mullberry Jane)
she made jam when she came
Somebody cut off her feet
now, jelly rolls in the street
If you want to see me
well, honey, you know that I'm not around
But if you want to hear me
why don't you just turn around
and by the window where the light is
She's my best friend
certainly not just like your average dog or car
She's my best friend
she understands me when I'm feeling -
- Down-down-down-down-down-down
you know it sure hurts to be that way
Down-down-down-down-down-down
you know it sure hurts to know that you're that kinda fella
Let's hear one for Newspaper Joe (Newspaper Joe)
he caught his hand in the door (caught his hand in the door)
Dropped his, ah, teeth on the floor, they say

If you want to see, yeah, see me
well, baby, you know that I'm not around
But if you want to feel, yeah, feel me

You're the kind of girl that
everybody's warned me about
You're the kind of person that

Your old man was the best P and E man
down on the streets
And all the guy in the precinct
always was watching for him on the beat
But when he ripped off Seymour
he was really not a doing so fine
And everything is knots, well except -

he see they just make them strip off, they say
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh
ooohhh baby, ooohhh
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh

It's very funny asking me
why they keep the lights on down so low
Well, yesterday's chase's today's competition
or didn't you know
And all the fluorescent lighting make so your wrinkles
they don't show
And it's very funny the way that
20 bucks an hour cannot go
if you don't make 'em go, now, now, now
Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh

Ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby, ooohhh baby

You know, man, when I was a young man in high school
You believe in or not, that I wanted to play football for the coach
All those older guys, they said he was mean and cruel
But you know, I wanted to play football, for the coach
They said I was to little too light weight to play line-back
So I say I'm playing right-in
Wanted to play football for the coach
Cause, you know some day, man, you gotta stand up straight
Unless you're gonna fall
Then you're gonna die
And the straightest dude I ever knew
Was standing right for me, all the time
So I had to play football for the coach
And I wanted to play football for the coach
When you're all alone and lonely in your midnight hour
And you find that your soul, it has been up for sale
And you getting to think about, all the things you done
And you getting to hate just about everything
But remember the princess who lived on the hill
Who loved you even though she knew you was wrong
And right now she just might come shining through
and the glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, just might come through
And all your two-bit friends have gone and ripped you off
They're talking behind your back saying, man
you are never going to be a human being
And you start thinking again
About all those things that you've done
And who it was and who it was
And all the different things you made every different scene
Ah, but remember that the city is a funny place
Something like a circus or a sewer
And just remember, different people have peculiar tastes
And the Glory of love, the glory of love
The glory of love, might see you through
Yeah, but now, now
Glory of love, the glory of love
The glory of love, might see you through
Glory of love, ah, huh, huh, the glory of love
Glory of love, glory of love
Glory of love, now, glory of love, now
Glory of love, now, now, now, glory of love
Glory of love, give it to me now, glory of love see you through

Picking up pieces of information
Down on the docks
Picking up pieces of information about you

And girl, I'm never ever gonna get hurt
'cause you treated me -
Oh, so senselessly cruel
Oh now, so senselessly cruel

You're caught in a vicious circle
surrounded by your so called friends
You're caught in a vicious circle
and it looks like it will never end
'Cause some people think that they like problems
and some people think that they don't
And for everybody who says yes
there's somebody who's staring, saying don't
You're caught in a vicious circle
surrounded by your so called friends
You're caught in a vicious circle
and it looks like it will just never end
'Cause some people think that it's nerves
and some people think that it's not
And some people think that it's things that you do
and others think that you were cold when you were hot
They think that, that is what it was about
You're caught in a vicious circle
You're caught in a vicious circle
You're caught in a vicious circle
You're caught in a vicious circle
surrounded by all of your friends
Never been to England, never been to France
never really learned how to dance
I've never taken dope and I've never taken drugs
ah, I've never danced on a bear-skin rug
Guess it's true, what all those people they say
I'm gonna have to loose my hometown ways
Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life
Never went around with anything
I've had a hometown life, and I have never learned to swing
Not much of a life, I haven't seen much
I've been true to my wife and it's just been too much
Guess it's true, what all these people they say
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
You know it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life
Guess it's true, what all those people they say
I'm gonna have to lose my hometown ways
Guess it's true, guess I've led a sheltered life
Hey now, bitch, now, baby
you better make your face get out of here, quick
Maybe your, was getting, ah, too rich
It ain't like we ain't never seen this thing before
And if it turns you then around
then you better hit the door
But I know, oh, it's just a temporary thing
Oh yeah, it's just a temporary thing
You've read too many books, you've seen too many plays
And it's things like this, that turn you away
Hey, now, now, look, huh, look, hey look, hey look
you better think about it twice
I know that your good breeding makes it seem not so nice
It's just a temporary thing
Ah-ha, ah-ha, ah-ha, it's just a temporary thing
Where's the number, where's the dime and where's the phone
I feel like a stranger, I guess you wanna go back home
Your mother, your father, your brother
I guess they wouldn't agree with me
But I don't give two shits, they're no better than me
Ah-ha, it's just a temporary thing
Oh yeah, been there before just a temporary thing
It's just a temporary thing
Ah bitch, get off my kids, temporary thing
Get out, it's just a temporary thing
Yeah now, home (it's just a temporary thing)
Temporary thing, huh, ah-ha (it's just a temporary thing)

Hey, if that ain't the rock'n'roll animal himself, what you doing bro.
(Standing on the corner)
Well, I can see that, what you got in your hand
(Suitcase in my hand)
No, shit, what's this
(Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest)
Fucking faggot Johnson
(Jack, sweet Jane, I'm in a rock'n'roll band)
Well, I can see that
Some people say that you can't - (no no no)
No matter how good you are
And some people say, they can't move - (no no no)
No matter where they are
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain
No matter how ugly you are
You know to me it all looks the same
Rain from the morning in the blue clouds
Now just shining up with dew
Riding through the city in their big cars
And me, I ain't got nothing to do
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain
Don't you know things always look ugly
To me they always look the same
Oh, gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times
Oh, Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain
Don't you know that most things look ugly
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know
To me they always look the same
It's been a long time, since I've spoken to you
was it the right time
Your current troubles, and you know, they'll get much worse
I hope you know how much you enjoy them
You're a pig of a person, If there's a justice in this world
hey, how about that
Your lack of conscience and your lack of morality
well, more and more people know all about it
Do you remember that song by a dude named Bobby Fuller
It went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
We sat around the other night, me and the guys
trying to find the right word
That would best fit and describe
you people like that
That no principle has touched, no principle's baptized
how about that
They'd  eat shit and say it tasted good
if there was some money in it for them
Hey, you remember that song about this guy from Texas
Whose name was --- Bobby Fuller
I'll sing it for you, it went like this:
I fought the law and the law won
I fought the law and the law won
You're just dirt
You're just dirt, The only word for you is dirt
That's the only word that -
- hurt, You're just dirt
That's all you're worth - cheap, cheap dirt
You know they call it -
Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
you're just - cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
You're just dirt - nothing but - cheap uptown dirt
That's all you're worth - It's just - cheap, cheap, uptown dirt
That's all you're worth now (cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
You're just dirt (cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
(Cheap, cheap, cheap, cheap, uptown dirt)
Waltzing Matilda
Waltzing Matilda whipped out her wallet
the sexy boy smiled in dismay
She took out four twenties 'cause she liked round figures
everybody's queen for a day
Oh, babe, I'm on fire and you know I admire your -
- body why don't we slip away
Although I'm sure you're certain, it's a rarity me flirtin'
sha-la-la-la, this way
Oh, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
hey, baby, come on, let's slip away
Luscious and gorgeous, oh what a humpin' muscle
call out the national guard
She creamed in her jeans as he picked up her knees
from off of the formica topped bar
And cascading slowly, he lifted her wholly
and boldly out of this world
And despite people's derision
proved to be more than diversion
sha-la-la-la, later on
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he entered her slowly
and showed her where he was coming from
And then sha-la-la-la-la, he made love to her gently
it was like she'd never ever come
And then sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
when the sun rose and he made to leave
You know, sha-la-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la-la
neither one regretted a thing
Street Hassle
Hey, that cunt's not breathing
I think she's had too much
of something or other, hey, man, you know what I mean?
I don't mean to scare you
but you're the one who came here
and you're the one who's gotta take her when you leave
I'm not being smart
or trying to be cold on my part
and I'm not gonna wear my heart on my sleeve
But you know people get all emotional
and sometimes, man, they just don't act rational you know,
they think they're just on TV
Sha-la-la-la, man
why don't you just slip her away
You know, I'm glad that we met man
it really was nice talking
and I really wish that there was a little more time to speak
But you know it could be a hassle
trying to explain this all to a police officer
about how it was that your old lady got herself stiffed
And it's not like we could help
but there wasn't nothing no one could do
and if there was, man, you know I would have been the first
But when someone turns that blue
well, it's a universal truth
and then you just know that bitch will never fuck again
By the way, that's really some bad shit
that you came to our place with
but you ought to be more careful around the little girls
It's either the best or it's the worst
and since I don't have to choose
I guess I won't and I know this ain't no way to treat a guest
But why don't you grab your old lady by the feet
and just lay her out in the darkest street
and by morning, she's just another hit and run.
You know, some people got no choice
and they can never find a voice
to talk with that they can even call their own
So the first thing that they see
that allows them the right to be
why they follow it, you know, it's called bad luck.
Slipaway
well hey(man), that's just a lie,
it's a lie she tells her friends.
'cause the real song, the real song
where she won't even admit to herself
the beatin' in her heart.
It's a song lots of people know.
It's a painful song
a little sad truth
but life full of sad songs
penny for a wish
But wishin' won't make you a soldier.
With a pretty kiss for a pretty face
can't have its way
Y'know tramps like us, we were born to pay.
Love has gone away
and there's no one here now
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh, how I miss him, baby
Oh, baby, come on and slip away
come on, baby, why don't you slip away
Love is gone away
took the rings off my fingers
And there's nothing left to say
but, oh how, oh how I need him, baby
Come on, baby, I need you baby
oh, please don't slip away
I need your loving so bad, babe
please don't slip away
I wanna be black, have natural rhythm
Shoot twenty foot of jism too

I wanna be black, I wanna be a panther
Have a girlfriend named Samantha

All the people had their share of the glory
looking out after you
It's just a story about winners and glory
and you know that it's true
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Some men may glory from a different condition
of another car
And later persuasion would permit the arranging
of a ...
And to cause more confusion, and to make this illusion
would have gone too far
And it's my ambition, of a jacket ignition
in a Cadillac metal car
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star
You're just a shooting star
Everybody's gonna try to tell you what to do, uhh-haa
And never, never, never, never, let it be said that it's true
oh-oh, hey, give it to my baby
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
They're the kind of people that'll always let you down
I know you, too, you don't ever give it a frown
oh, do it, do it, now, do it, do it
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
get down, baby
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
oh, come now, leave me alone, mam, okay, baby
Oh, oh, yeah

Ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
ah-ha-ha, oh, oh, yeah
Ah-ha-ha
Don't you know some people, they just don't know when to stop
give it to me, now
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top
And there're other types, they always make you wait
And they're always the first to say, the state you come from
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone, oh
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone
leave me alone

Ah-ha-ha
Wait (disgrace)
I know I shouldn't, but we'll wait (such a pretty face)
I know the time is getting late (... such a waste)
And here is what you hesitate (such a pretty face)
But still I really wish that you'd wait (... such a waste)
Although the passion might abate (such a pretty face)
And find you in another state (it's such a state)
That will seem just as a mistake (it's such a waste)
Oh baby, I really think that I oughta wait (such a pretty face)
Wait (it was such a waste)
I really wouldn't want your hate (it's such a pretty face)
Certainly not after like late (... such a waste)
You wanna give not only take  (it's such a pretty face)
I know propriety is such a waste (it's such a disgrace)
But then it says you really have to wait (such a pretty face)
Considering the present state (... such a waste)
Don't change my mind at such a late stage (... such a waste)
Oh baby, don't you think you oughta wait (such a pretty face)
Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...
Ooohhh ...
Wait

Disco, disco mystic
Disco, disco mystic
Disco, disco mystic
Hey pretty baby
don't you think you might give me a chance
Get it on with me
go downtown for some love and romance
And I know I ain't nothing
I ain't worth but a thin dime
But if you put your heart in my hands
I'm sure that I could change your mind
I wanna boogie with you
Yeah, I wanna boogie with you
There's something, baby, that your parents
both agreed
And that is that they both had it
deep distrust for me
And your best friend Frankie
well I know your best friend Frankie, he wants to see me sink
And I don't much blame him for that
he gets so useless after so few drinks, you know, baby
I wanna boogie with you
I wanna boogie with you
Well I know your little baby sister
she thinks that I'm a flop
But I guess that you know that it's true
I spent more time at the bottom than the top
Tell your little sister
I know she wants to give me a whirl
But I don't have the time, baby
to wait till she's grown up and she's a woman, not a girl
Don't you know I wanna boogie with you
Hey, I wanna boogie with you
I wanna boogie with you
I wanna boogie with you, yeah
Boogie with you
Down on the corner
boogie with you, yeah
With you, life moves so fast

Slow down
Don't you think you could be less capricious
I'm not you, I don't have no death wish
Slow down
slow down
With you, there is no denying
it's you, not my lack of trying
With you, everybody's lying
it's you, it's not me who's crying
Crying, crying
crying, crying
With you, stay and hold tightly from the streets
with you, every friend's a possible beat
Slow down
slow down
With you, it's a foregone conclusion
with you, envy, it's all a delusion
With you, I can have no illusions
it's you, who has the contusions
Crying, crying
crying, crying
With you, everyone's a sucker
with you, it's fuckee or fucker
Slow down
slow down
With you, life is just a scramble
with you, every day is a gamble
With you, I can't forget life barely
with you, playing the Virgin Mary
And your crying, crying
crying, crying
Crying, crying
Hey, hey, hey

Don't these city lights
light these streets to life
Don't these crazy nights
bring us together
Any rainy day
you can dance those blues away
Don't these city lights
bring us together
Charlie Chaplin's cane
well it flicked away the rain
Things weren't quite the same
after he came here
But then when he left
upon our own request
Things weren't quite the same
after he came here
Don't these city lights
bring the streets to life
Don't these crazy nights
bring us together
Any rainy day
you can dance those blues away
Don't these city lights
bring us together
We're supposed to be
a land of liberty
And those city lights
to blaze forever
But that little tramp
leaning on that street corner lamp
When he left us
his humor left forever
We're supposed to be
a land of liberty
And those city lights
to blaze forever
But that little tramp
leaning on that street corner lamp
When he left us
his humor left us forever, ever
Don't these city lights
bring the streets to life
Don't these crazy nights
bring us together
Any rainy day
you can dance those blues away
Don't these city lights
bring us together
Together
Don't you feel so lonely when it's in the afternoon
and you gotta face it
all through the night
Don't it make you believe
that something's gonna have to happen soon
oh baby, all through the night
All through the night
oh baby, all through the night
All through the night
all through the night
Have you ever played with an all night band
and gone trough it, baby
all through the night
When the daytime descends in a night time of hell
everybody's gone to look for a bell to ring
all through the night
And they do it, all through the night
babe, all through the night
When the words were donw and the poetry comes
and the novel's written and the book is done
you said, oh Lord, lover, baby, give it to me
all through the night
And she says it
My best friend Sally, she got sick
and I'm feeling mighty ill myself it happens all the time
and all through the night
I went to Saint Vincent's and I'm watching the ceiling
fall down on her body as she's lying round on the ground
said, oh babe, gotta celebrate all through the night
Feel so sad I cried all through the night
I said, oh Jesus, all through the night
If the sinners sin and the good man's gone
and a woman can't come and help him home
and what you're gonna do about it
when they go on all through the night
and they sing, oh baby, oh baby, oh baby
all through the night
and he says, give it to me all through the night
It ain't so much when a man's gotta cry
give a little loving and some peace of mind
I said, hey babe, give it to me all through the night
And some people wait for things that never come
and some people dream of things they've never been done
they do it, oh baby, all through the night
The city's funny and the country's quiet
but I'd wanna know why they don't have a riot
why don't they do it, baby, all through the night
Ooohhh mama, ooohhh mama, tell me 'bout it
all through the night
I want to have it all through the night
If Christmas comes only once a year
why can't anybody shed just one tear
for things that don't happen all through the night
Ooohhh mama, all through the night
oh baby, do it to me all through the night
Easy, easy, baby, why don't you give it to -
- me all through the night
(How's the family)
(How's the family)
Mama, you tell me how's the family
And papa, tell me how thing's going by you
And little baby sister, I heard that you got married
And I heard that you had yourself a little baby girl, too
And here's some uncles and some cousins I know vaguely
And would you believe my old dog Chelsea's here, too
And would you believe nobody in this family
wanted to keep her
And now that dog's more of a part of this family
then I am, too
I don't come home much anymore
No-no-no I don't come home much anymore
Mama
And mama, I know how disappointed you are
And papa, I know that you feel the same way, too
And no-no-no-no-no I still haven't got married
And no-no-no there's no grandson planned here for you
And by the way, daddy tell me how's the business
I understand that your stock she's growing very high
No, daddy, you're not a poor man anymore
And I hope you'll realize that before you die
Because I don't come home much anymore
No-no-no-no-no I don't come home much no more
But daddy
And please-please-please-please-please
come on let's not start this business again
I know how much you resent the life that I have
But one more time, I don't want the family business
Don't want to inherit it upon the day that you die
Really, daddy should have given it to my sister
You know Elisabeth, you know Elisabeth
she has a better head for those things than I
She lives practically around the corner
That's really the kind of child you could be proud of
But papa, I know that this visit's a mistake
There's nothing here we have in common, except our name
And families that live out in the suburbs
Often make each other cry
And I don't think that I'll come home much anymore
No-no, I don't think I'll come home much again
Mama
Papa
Families
Often make each other cry
No, I don't think that I'll come home much anymore
(How's the families)
And the actresses relate
to the actor who comes home late
after the plays have gone down
and the crowds have scattered around
Though the city lights and the streets
no ticket could be beat
for the beautiful show of shows
ah, Broadway only knows
The great white Milky Way
it had something to say
when he fell down on his knees
after soaring through the air
With nothing to hold him there
it was really not so cute
to play without a parachute
as he stood upon the ledge
Looking out, he thought he saw a brook
And he hollered, Look, there are the bells
and he sang out, Here come the bells
Here come the bells, here come the bells
here come the bells
Here come the bells
here come the bells
Here come the bells
here come the bells
A son who is cursed with a harridan mother
or a weak simpering father at best
Is raised to play out the timeless classical motives
of filial love and incest
How does he speak to a
How does he speak to the prettiest girl
How does he talk to her
What does he say for an opening line
What does he say if he's shy
What do you do with your pragmatic passions
with your classically neurotic style
How do you deal with your vague self-comprehension's
what do you do when you lie
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to her
How do you dance on the head of a pin
When you're on the outside looking in
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
How do you speak to a
How do you speak to the prettiest girl
You just say, Hello, (hello) Baby (hello)
...
Baby, angel, how do you talk to the prettiest girl, you say
Hello baby, hello baby, angel, angel, pretty little girl
Angel, angel ....
When I was a young boy in Brooklyn
going to public school
During recess in the concrete playground
they lined us up by twos
In alphabetical order, Reagan, Reed and Russo
I still remember the names
And stickball and stoopball were the only games
that we played
And I wanted to be like my old man
I, I wanted to grow up just like my old man
I wanted to be like my old man
I wanted to dress like, I wanted to be just like
I wanted to act like my old man
I wanted to be like, I wanted to act like
I wanted to be just like my old man
And then like everyone else I started to grow
And I didn't want to be like my father anymore
I was sick of his bullying
and having to hide under a desk on the floor
And when he beat my mother
it made me so mad I could choke
And I didn't want to be like my old man
I, I didn't even want to look like my old man
I didn't even want to seem like my old man
A son watches his father, being cruel to his mother
and makes a vow to return only when
He is so much richer, in every way so much bigger that -
- the old man will never hit anyone again
Like my old man (just like my old man)
like my old man
Like my old man (just like my old man)
like my old man
and can you believe what he said to me
he said, "Lou, act like a man" (walk like a man)
Why don't you act just like a man
act like your daddy, act like a man (just like my old man)
Oh, why don't you act just like a man
like your old man (walk like a man)
(Just like my old man)
(Just like my old man)
You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself
you know that I'm not seeing anyone else
You just keep your ear down to the ground
yell your head off if you hear a sound
Here's a whistle, a badge and a phone
you can arrest me if I'm not at home
And if I don't keep my word I swear
I'll keep away
Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher
here's Shakespeare's Measure For Measure
Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag
why don't you blow them up if you think you've been had
Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat
an earring, a toothbrush and a cloak
And if I don't keep my word I swear
I'll keep away
I swear I'll keep away, from all we've ever done
I'll keep away the good times, I'll keep away the fun
I swear I'll join the army, or maybe the marines
I'll start to wear designer suits and put away my jeans
I swear that I'll keep away, from all my old-time friends
I'll throw away my records, I'll try to make amends
I swear I'll give up gambling, and playing with the rent
I'll give up food and drinking, I'll give up a life ill-spent
Here's a yardstick you can measure me by
here's a coupon, maybe there's something you want to buy
Here's a bandied in case you cut your feet
here's a rubber mallet you can use on your front teeth
Here's a gun no one uses anymore
and a bracelet made of some expensive ore
And if I don't keep my word
you won't see me anymore
I swear I'll keep away, from dignity and pride
I'll keep away from abstracts, I'll keep it all inside
Well, I'll just wrap me up in butter, and melt me on a shelf
I'll fry in my own juices, I'll become somebody else
Well, I'll just swear to keep away, from everything that's good
I'll lie down in the gutter, where I really should
I swear I'll light a candle, to every modern foe
I swear I'll close the book on this, and not see you anymore
'cause I just got to get away
Some people are into the power of power
The absolute corrupting power, that makes great men insane
While some people find their refreshment in action
The manipulation, encroachment and destruction of their inferiors
Growing up in public, growing up in public
Growing up in public, growing up in public with your pants down
Some people are into sadistic pleasures
They whet their desires and drool in your ears
They're quasi-effeminate characters in love with oral gratification
They edify your integrities, so they can play on your fears
They're gonna do you in public, 'cause you're growing up in public
They're gonna do it to you in public,
'Cause you're growing up in public with your pants down
Some people think being a man is unmanly
Some people think that the whole concept's a joke
But some people think being a man is the whole point
And then some people wish they'd never awoke
Up from a dream of nightmarish proportions
Down to a size neither regal nor calm
A Prince Hamlet caught the middle between reason and instinct
Caught in the middle with your pants down again
Caught in the middle, I'm really caught in the middle
I'm caught in the middle, caught in the middle deciding about you
Remember your manners
will you please take your hat off
Your mother is dying
listen to her cough
We were always standing on ceremony
We were always standing on ceremony
Can't you show some respect please
although you didn't in real life
Your mother is dying
and I god damn well hope you're satisfied
We were always standing on ceremony
We were always standing on ceremony
So please play another song on that juke box
Please play another pretty sad song for me
And if that phone rings, tell them that you haven't seen me
If that last phone rings
tell them that you haven't seen me for weeks
and this one here's on me
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony
Standing on ceremony, you were always standing on ceremony
(Standing, on ceremony)
(Standing, on ceremony)
(Standing, on ceremony)
(Standing, on ceremony)
(Standing, on ceremony)
(Standing, on ceremony)
...
She calls on the phone
she says she doesn't want to be alone
She says it's making her neurotic
but please don't mistake it for being erotic
So alone, so all alone
She says let's go for a walk
we'll have a drink and maybe we will talk
And he thinks she has possibilities
if she could just put away her rosary
So alone, nobody wants to be alone
But I just didn't know
I swear to you, I just didn't know
I would never make you sad
if I had known I never would have
said those things to you
you have to be crazy to say those things to you
Let's face it I made a mistake
well you know, fools rush in where angels take a break
I can't be smart all of the time
and anyway I didn't know you were making time over him
To tell you the truth, I forget all about him
And you know, I don't think it's nice
asking one man about another man's vice
I don't care if you pick my head
as long as we end up in bed
Alone, just the two of us alone
I just didn't know
I swear to God, I just didn't know
Can't you understand that it's frightening
when you hear women talking about castrating and hating men
who wants to know about how you hate men
Well, you said now you wanted to dance
so now we're going to dance
You said that you weren't complete
but we're going to put you on your feet
You said that you were very vexed
you told me to forget about sex
You said you liked me for my mind
well, I really love your behind
Oh, get up and boogie, oh baby, get up and dance
Oh, get, get, get, get up and boogie, baby, oh, get up and dance
Shake your booty, mama, oh, get up and dance
Your points very clear
you're not one to cry into your beer
Why don't we go to my place
believe me, I'm very chaste
And I'm so alone, ao all alone
Sure all men are beasts
hey, look, I'll sit here quietly and I'll stare at my feet
I don't blame you for taking umbrage
with animals staring at your cleavage
So alone, we're so all alone
Hey, do you mind if I turn out the light
don't take offense, but why don't you spend the night
I know your passions run very deep
but at this point we both need sleep
So alone, and who wants to be alone
Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay
They both love Chinese food, he hates to dress
he loves to play pinball, she wants to play next
She likes her novels long, he's into comic books
they're gilt-edged polymorphous urban but somehow it works
'Cause love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay
She likes Truman Capote, he likes Gore Vidal
he likes Edgar Allan Poe, she's into Mean Joe Greene
She thinks eating meat's disgusting, he likes hot dogs
she's into Gestalt therapy
while est and the vest just make him ill
But love is here to stay
Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay
Love is here, here to stay
love is here, here to stay
It gets proven every day
love is here, here to stay
Some like wine and some like hops
but what I really love is my scotch
It's the power, the power of positive drinking
Some people ruin their drinks with ice
and then they, they ask you for advice
They tell you, I've never told anyone else before
They say, Candy is dandy but liquor makes quipsters
and I don't like mixers, or sippers or sob sisters
You know, you have to be real careful where you sit down
in a bar these days
And then some people drink to unleash their libidos
and other people drink to prop up their egos
It's my burdon, man, people say
I have the kind of face you can trust
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
Some people say, alcohol makes you less lucid
and think that's true if you're kind of stupid
I'm not that kind that get's himself burned twice
And some say liquor kills the cells in your head
and for that matter so does getting out of bed
When I exit, I'll go out gracefully, shot in my hand
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
The pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive
the pow-pow-pow-pow-power of positive drinking
Smiles, I was taught never to smile
I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery
chicanery and larceny abound
My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera
a smile is the last thing that you wanna do
Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles
Smiles, they all smile on TV
The quizmaster with his withered crones
the talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet
The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover
all smile out from the news, at one time or another
Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles
When I was young my mother said to me
never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy
Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
they'll always put you down
With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
they'll always put you down
With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile
don't you know they'll make you go
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo
doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)
Waking, he stared raptly at her face
on his lips, her smell, her taste
Black hair framing her perfect face
with her wonderful mind and her incredible grace
And so, he woke, he woke her with a start
to offer her his heart
for once and for all, forever to keep
And the words, that she first heard him speak
were really very sweet
he was asking her to marry him, and to
Think it over
baby, think it over
Think it over
baby, why don't you think it over
She said, somewhere, there's a faraway place
where all is ordered and all is grace
No one there is ever disgraced
and everyBODY there is wise and everyone has taste
And then she sighed, well la-dee-dah-dee-dah
you and I have come quite far
and we really must watch what we say
Because when you ask for someone's heart
you must know that you're smart
smart enough to care for it, so I'm gonna
Think it over
baby, think it over
Think it over
Baby, I'm gonna think it over
Teach the gifted children
teach them to have mercy
Teach them about sunsets
teach them about moonrise
Teach them about anger
the sin that comes with dawning
Teach them about flowers
and the beauty of forgetfulness
Then take me to the river (take me to the river)
and put me in the water (and put me in the water)
Bless them and forgive them (take me to the river)
father cause they just don't know (take me to the river)
All the gifted children
Teach the gifted children
the way of men and animals
Teach them about cities
the history of the mysteries
Their vice and their virtues
about branches that blow in the wind
On the wages of their sins
teach them of forgiveness
teach them about mercy
Teach them about music
and the cool and cleansing waters
What do they say, take me to the river (take me to the river)
take me to the river (take me to the river)
Put me in the water  (take me to the river)
and teach the gifted children (take me to the river)
All the gifted children (take me to the river)
(Take me to the river)
(Take me to the river)
The image of the poet's in the breeze
Canadian geese are flying above the trees
A mist is hanging gently on the lake
my house is very beautiful at night
My friend and teacher occupies a spare room
he's dead, at peace at last the wandering Jew
Other friends had put stones on his grave
he was the first great man that I had ever met
Sylvia and I got out our Ouija Board
to dial a spirit, across the room it soared
We were happy and amazed at what we saw
blazing stood the proud and regal name Delmore
Delmore, I missed all your funny ways
I missed your jokes and the brilliant things you said
My Dedalus to your Bloom, was such a perfect wit
and to find you in my house makes things perfect
I really got a lucky life
my writing, my motorcycle and my wife
And to top it all off a spirit of pure poetry
is living in this stone and wood house with me
The image of the poet's in the breeze
Canadian geese are flying above the trees
A mist is hanging gently on the lake
our house is very beautiful at night
Our house is very beautiful at night
our house is very beautiful at night
Our house is very beautiful at night
I love women, I think they're great
they're a solace to the world in a terrible state
They're a blessing to the eyes, a balm to soul
what a nightmare to have no women in the world
I love women
I love women
I love women
we all love women
I used to look at women in the magazines
I know that it was sexist, but I was in my teens
I was very bitter, all my sex was on the sly
I couldn't keep my hands off women, and I won't till I die
I love women
ah, I love women
we love women
we all love women
A woman's love can lift you up, and women can inspire
I feel like buying flowers and hiring a celestial choir
A choir of castratis to serenade my love
they'd sing a little Bach for us and then we'd make love
I love women
I love women
We all love women
we love women
Ooohhh-wheee, look at me
looking for some sympathy
It's the same old story -
- of a man and his search for glory
and he found it, there underneath the bottle
Things are never good, things go from bad to weird
hey gimme another scotch with my beer
I'm sad to say -
- I feel the same today as I always do
gimme a drink to relax me
Ooohhh-wheee, liquor set free
I can't do no work, the shake's inside me
Ahhh, shucks
I got the lousiest luck, I'm sick of this
underneath the bottle
Seven days make a week, on two of them I sleep
I can't remember what the heck I was doing
I got bruise on my leg -
- from I can't remember when
I fell down some stairs, I was lyin' underneath the bottle
Ooohhh 0wheee, son of a B.
you get so down, you can't get any lower
So long world, you play too rough
and it's getting me all mixed up
I lost my pride and it's hiddin' there underneath the bottle
The man has a gun
he knows how to use it
Nine millimeter Browning
let's see what he can do
He'll point at your mouth
say that he'll blow your brains out
Don't you mess with me
carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
carrying a gun
Don't you mess with me
carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
carrying a gun
Don't mess with me
ooohhh, carrying a gun
Get over there
move slowly
I'll put a hole in your face
if you even breathe a word
Tell the lady to lie down
I want, ah, you to be sure to see this
I wouldn't want you to miss a second
watch your wife
Carrying a gun
shooting with a gun
Dirty animal
Carrying a gun
carrying a gun
Watch you face
carrying a gun
Carrying a gun
carrying a gun
The animal dies with fear in his eyes
with a gun
Don't touch him, don't touch him
stay away from him, he's got a gun
They tied his arms behind his back
to teach him how to swim
They put blood in his coffee
and milk in his gin
They stood over the soldier
in the midst of the squalor
There was war in his body
and it caused his brain to holler
Make the sacrifice
mutilate my face
If you need someone to kill
I'm a man without a will
Wash the razor in the rain
let me luxuriate in pain
Please don't set me free
death means a lot to me
The pain was lean and it made him scream
he knew he was alive
He put a pin through the nipples on his chest
he thought he was a saint
I've made love to my mother, killed my father and brother
what am I to do
When a sin goes too far, it's like a runaway car
it cannot be controlled
Spit upon his face and scream
there's no Oedipus today
This is no play you're thinking you are in
what will you say
Take the blue mask down from my face
and look me in the eye
I get a thrill from punishment
I've always been that way
I loathe and despise repentance
you are permanently stained
Your weakness buys indifference
and indiscretion in the streets
Dirty's what you are and clean is what you're not
you deserve to be soundly beat
Make the sacrifice
take it all the way
There's no "won't" high enough
to stop this desperate day
Don't take death away
cut the finger at the joint
Cut the stallion at his mount
and stuff it in his mouth
I ain't no Christian or no born again saint
I ain't no cowboy or Marxist D.A.
I ain't no criminal or Reverend Cripple from the right
I am just your average guy, trying to do what's right
I'm just your average guy
an average guy
I am just your average guy
I'm just an average guy
Average guy, I'm just your average guy
I'm average looking and I'm average inside
I'm an average lover and I live in an average place
you wouldn't know me if you met me face to face
I'm just your average guy
average guy
Average guy
I'm just an average guy
I worry about money and taxes and such
I worry that my liver's big and it hurts to the touch
I worry about my health and bowels
and the crime waves in the street
I'm really just your average guy
trying to stand on his own two feet
I'm just your average guy
I'm just your average guy
I'm just your average guy
average guy
Average looks, average taste
average height, an average waist
Average in everything I do
my temperature is 98.2
I'm just your average guy
an average guy
Average guy
I'm just an average guy
Average guy
I'm just your average guy
I'm just your average guy
I'm just your average guy
Average
The heroine stood up on the deck
The ship was out of control
The bow was being ripped to shreds
Men were fighting down below
The sea had pummeled the boat for so long
That they knew nothing but fear
And the baby's in the box, he thinks the door is locked
The sea is in a state, the baby learns to wait
For the heroine, ooohh for the heroine
Locked in his defense, he waits for the heroine
The mast is cracking as he waves are slapping
Sailors roll across the deck
And when they thought none was looking
They would cut a weaker man's neck
While the heroine dressed in a virgin white dress
Tried to steer the mighty ship
But the raging storm wouldn't hear of it
They were in for a long trip
Baby's in the box, he thinks the door is locked
He finds it hard to breathe, drawing in the sea
And where's the heroine to fire off the gun
To calm the raging seas and let herself be seized by the
Baby in the box, he thinks the door is locked
The woman has the keys
But there is no moment she can seize
Here's to the heroine, who transcends all the men
Who are locked inside the box
Will the lady let them out
Ooohh the heroine, ooohh the heroine
Strapped to the mast, the pale ascendant heroine...
Waves of fear, attack in the night
waves of revulsion, sickening sights
My heart's nearly bursting, my chest's choking tight
Waves of fear, waves of fear
Waves of fear, squat on the floor
looking for some pill, the liquor is gone
Blood drips from my nose, I can barely breathe
waves of fear, I'm too scared to leave
Waves of fear, waves of fear
waves of fear, waves of fear
I'm too afraid to use the phone
I'm too afraid to put the light on
I'm so afraid I've lost control
I'm suffocating without a word
Crazy with sweat, spittle on my jaw
what's that funny noise, what's that on the floor
Waves of fear, pulsing with death
I curse my tremors, I jump at my own step
I cringe at my terror, I hate my own smell
I know where I must be, I must be in hell
Waves of fear, waves of fear
waves of fear, waves of fear
I dreamed I was the president of these United States
I dreamed I replaced ignorance, stupidity and hate
I dreamed the perfect union and a perfect law, undenied
And most of all I dreamed I forgot the day John Kennedy died
I dreamed that I could do the job that others hadn't done
I dreamed that I was uncorrupt and fair to everyone
I dreamed I wasn't gross or base, a criminal on the take
And most of all I dreamed I forgot the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
I remember where I was that day, I was upstate in a bar
The team from the university was playing football on TV
Then the screen went dead and the announcer said,
"There's been a tragedy
There's are unconfirmed reports the president's been shot
and he may be dead or dying."
Talking stopped, someone shouted, "What!?"
I ran out to the street
People were gathered everywhere saying,
did you hear what they said on TV
And then a guy in a Porsche with his radio hit his horn
and told us the news
He said, "The president's dead, he was shot twice in the head
in Dallas, and they don't know by whom."
I dreamed I was the president of these United States
I dreamed I was young and smart and it was not a waste
I dreamed that there was a point to life and to the human race
I dreamed that I could somehow comprehend that someone
shot him in the face
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Oh, the day John Kennedy died
Heavenly arms reach out to hold me
Heavenly arms entice you to dance
In a world of ill will, the dancers are still
Heavenly arms reach out to me
Heavenly arms soft as a love song
Heavenly arms bring a kiss to your ear
In a world that seems mad, all the dancers seem sad
Heavenly arms reach out to me
Sylvia
Sylvia
Sylvia
Sylvia
Heavenly arms come to my rescue
Only a woman can love a man
In a world full of hate, love should never wait
Heavenly arms reach out to me
Heavenly arms strong as a sunset
Heavenly arms pure as the rain
Lovers stand warned of the world's impending storm
Heavenly arms reach out to me
Sylvia
Sylvia
Sylvia
Sylvia
Ohhh-wohhh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, oh-woh-woh
Ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, ohh-woh-woh
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)
Legendary hearts
tearing up apart
with stories of their love
their great transcendent loves
While we stand here and fight
and lose another night
of legendary love
Legendary loves
haunt me in my sleep
promises to keep
I never should have made
I can't live up to this
I'm good for just a kiss
not legendary love
Romeo, oh, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo
he's in a car or at a bar
or churning his blood with an impure drug
He's in the past and seemingly lost forever
He worked hard at being good
but his basic soul was stained not pure
and when he took his bow
no audience was clapping
Legendary hearts
tear us all apart
make our emotions bleed
crying out in need
No legendary love
is coming from above
it's in this room right now
And you've got to fight
to make what's right
you've got to fight
to make what's right
You've got to fight
to make what's right
you've got to fight to keep your legendary love
A perfect day to get out of bed
shower, dress, shave, kiss you on the head
Then I hit the office and my head starts to swim
A perfect day to just walk around
see a violent movie, check the sounds
But even on the street
when I hear a phone ring my heart starts to beat
when I get home I don't want you to speak
Don't talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
with work, with work
How many dollars, how many sales
how many liars, how many tales
How many insults must you take in this one life
I'm in prison most of the day
so please excuse me, if I get this way
But I have got obligations to keep
so be very careful when you speak
Don't talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
with work, with work
Please don't talk to me about work
don't you talk to me about work
I'm up to my eyeballs in dirt
with work, with work
Don't talk to me about work
don't you talk to me about work
Don't you talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
Don't you talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
Don't you talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work
Don't you talk to me about work
please don't talk to me about work

I can't seem to make up my mind
I can't tell the colors
That will fit this room
I can't tell a thing about you make up my mind
I can't seem to make up my mind
are you laughing at me
Or telling a joke, the cigarette on the sheet
begins to smoke, make up your mind
Right or left, up or down
in or out, straight or round
Love or lust, rain or shine
I can't seem to make up my poor mind
I can't seem to make up my mind
I can't tell the difference between wrong and right
are you laughing at me in your sleep tonight
Leaving me behind
leaving me behind
Why don't you make up your mind
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
about leaving me, baby
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
(I can't seem to make up my mind)
I've declared a truce, so stop your fighting
the marshall is in town
I won't put up with no big mouth yapping
at least not while I'm around
This is my friend Ace, he's from the 8th precinct
nothing goes on that he don't know
And we've been send cause your arguments
have been going on for too long
And before one of you hurts the other one of you
I'm declaring martial law
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city
The jails are filled with people like you
you oughta listen to your diddy-wah-diddy
What's a girl like you doing with that lamp
you better drop it down on the floor
And son, that isn't very smart
kicking a hole in that door
Hey, Ace will you take a look at this place
and get those neighbors out of the hall
I'm declaring martial law
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
'cause I'm the marshall in the city
And if you stand away, I've got something to say
that I might even help you
Keep your hands to yourself and keep your big mouth shut
don't you touch nobody with hate-hate-hate-hate
And if all you've got is poison in your mouth
make sure that you don't speak
It's 3:30 in the early morning
don't punch, don't scratch, don't bite
Try not to take the garbage of the day
any place but outside
Now me and Mr. Ace are gonna leave this place
and this fighting's gonna end
And if we're called back, I'm gonna knock you flat
and stack you end to end
Ah, I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city, ooohhh
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
I'm the marshall in the city
I came, I saw, I declared martial law
'cause I'm the marshall in the city
Last shot sure killed me
pour another drink
Let's drink to the last shot
and the blood on the dishes in the sink
Blood inside the coffee cup
blood on the table top
But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
I shot blood at the fly on the wall
my heart almost stopped hardly there at all
I broke the mirror with my fall, with my -
- Fall-fall-fall
fall-fall-fall
Gimme a double, give yourself one two
gimme a short beer, one for you too
And a toast to everything that doesn't move
that doesn't move
But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
Whiskey, bourbon, vodka and scotch
I don't care what it is you've got
I just want to know that it's my last shot
My last shot
I remember when I quit pretty good
see this here, this is where I chipped my tooth
Shot of vein in my neck and I coughed up a Quaalude
On my last shot
my last shot
Here's a toast to all that's good
and here's a toast to hate
And here's a toast to toasting and I'm not boasting
When I say I'm getting straight
when I say I'm getting straight
But when you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
When you quit, you quit, but you always wish
that you knew it was your last shot
Lover, lover, why is there light
in the itchy gitchy evening and it's dark outside
And what's the difference between wrong and right
wrong and right
Isn't it funny how pain goes away
and then comes back another day
The air feels very good today
good today
Lover, lover, why is there light
did you forget to turn off that light
Well that's all right but it's way too bright
way too bright
See the eagle above the hill
the lake reflects and is so still
The tension has gone from my will
from my will
Moon on the mountain shining bright
first there is dark and then there is light
And sometimes the light is way too bright
it's way to bright
Why don't you turn out the light
oh, turn out the light
Why don't you turn out the light
turn out the light
Turn out the light
Turn out the light
Christopher Columbus discovered America
found he had a cornucopia
Gave love to the Indians, they gave it back
a pow wow in the teepee is where it's at
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
The Indian fought with his arrow and bow
till General Custer lost to Sitting Bull
Scalped all day and scalped all night
give me fire water, gonna buy me a wife
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
I want to dance with you
When your people first moved to our block
our ancestors met with culture shock
Two different monkeys from two different trees
come on let's stop our fightin' and come dance with me
Come on dance with me
come on and dance with me
'Cause I really wanna dance with you
I want to dance with you
come on and dance with me
Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
by the one who says she needs you
above all other men
Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
her father did his duty
and I lie down betrayed
Justice taught her confidence
her mother was like steel
her cousins, they're all convicts
she alone rose above that wheel
But a motorcyclist no matter how good
is slave to the oncoming truck
and the poison of her father was
her most pitiless luck
Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
by the one who says she needs you
above all other men
Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
her father did his duty
and I lie down betrayed
Three of us lie in this bed
night of infamy
one of us lies on our back
her father's in her head
And quick she turns and slaps my face
and with her eyes open wide she screams
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you
but she's looking right past me
Betrayed by the one who says she loves you
by the one who says that she needs you
above all other men
Betrayed by her fragile, vicious beauty
her father did his duty
and I lie down betrayed
And I lie down betrayed
I lie down betrayed
I'm cruising fast on a motorcycle
down this winding country road
And I pass the gravel on the foot of the hill
where last week I fell off
There's still some oil by the old elm tree
and a dead squirrel that I hit
But if I hadn't left, I would have struck you dead
so I took a ride instead
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Bottoming out
bottoming out
My doctor says, she hopes I know
how lucky I can be
after all it wasn't my blood
mixed in the dirt that night
But this violent rage, turned inward
can not be helped by drink
And we must really examine this and I say
I need another drink
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Bottoming out
bottoming out
I'm tearing down Route 80 east
the sun's on my right side
I'm drunk, but my vision's good
and I think of my child bride
And on the left in shadows
I see something that makes me laugh
I aim that bike at the fat pothole
beyond that underpass
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Bottoming out
bottoming out
Here's to Johnny with his Jo
and Mickey's got a wife
And here's to Jerry
he has got his Joyce
And me, I'm shaking
in my boots tonight
For the daughters and the sons
lost in the home of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that's not saved
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to Frank hit in some bar
in picturesque Brooklyn Heights
And here's to a friend who jumped in front of a train
at seven o'clock one night
And another friend who thinks he lacks worth
has disappeared from sight
Somewhere in the home
of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that's not saved
Here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
The stars are hiding in their clouds
the street lights are too bright
A man's kicking a woman
who's clutching his leg tight
And I think suddenly of you
and blink my eyes in fright
And rush off to the home
of the brave
And here's to the home of the brave
Here's to the home of the brave
And here's to the life that is saved
Here's to the home of the brave
And everyday you have to die some
cry some and die some
And everyday you have to die some
cry some and die
In the home of the brave
Home of the brave
Sitting in our rooftop garden
looking down below
Sitting in our rooftop garden
waiting for the sun
Isn't it lovely watching
a plane go by
What a lovely couple
are you and I
Sitting in our rooftop garden
a few drops of rain
The lights in the city blinking on
just the same
No sugar in my coffee
how's your tea
In our rooftop garden
above the city
Let's not see any letters
let's not answer the phone
Let's just pretend that
there's no one at home
In our rooftop garden
in our rooftop garden
In our rooftop garden
up on the roof
You broke my heart and you made me cry
You said that I couldn't dance
But now I'm back to let you know
That I can really make romance
You do what you gotta do
You do everything you can
You do what you wanna do
Hey, but I love you, suzanne
You do anything once
You try anything twice
You so what you gotta do
Hey, but I love you, suzanne, hey, hey

You know that I love you, suzanne
Jealousy, endlessly
sweeps through my mind
Jealousy, often causes me to
be unkind
I'm sorry I said that
I'm sorry I did that
I'm sorry I hit you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Endlessly jealous of you
being endlessly jealous of me
The man that you thought I could be turning red
with jealousy
Endlessly jealousy
eats through my skull
Endlessly jealousy
makes me feel dull
Fighting
endless jealous fighting
I feel my fingers tightening
tightening, please don't break her arm
Jealously thinking of you
of your endless possession of me
Of my jealousy, endlessly, jealousy, endlessly
jealous of you
Sorry, running to a phone to say
I'm sorry, running out of dimes
the phone on the street spits at me
have a good day
Sorry, please you know how I am sorry
I've been this way for
Oh, so long, endlessly, zealously
jealous of you
Jealousy, endlessly
eats through my mind
Jealousy, endlessly
makes me be unkind
I'm sorry I said that
I'm sorry I did that
I'm sorry I hit you
I'm sorry, I'm sorry
Endlessly jealous of you
being endlessly jealous of me
Endlessly jealous of you being endlessly
jealous of me
Endlessly jealous of you
Endlessly jealous of you
Endlessly jealous of you
Endlessly jealous of you
The first bite of the apple made Eve smart
the second bite taught her how to break men's hearts
The third bite taught her how to strut her stuff
but she never got to the fourth bite
that says "Enough is enough"
Enough is enough, baby, I've had enough of you
you can keep your dresses, you can keep your jewels
You can keep the color TV, those soaps just make me sick
all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
My red joystick, my red joystick
all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
My red joystick, my red joystick
all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
Eve kissed Able, that's how he got murdered by Cain
Abraham gave up his son, to keep his wife away
And even the Lord Almighty
speaking from the trenches to the pits
spoke for all of mankind, when he said
Take the Porsche, take the kids
take the stocks, baby, take the rugs
Take those roses from my poor heart wilting
but, please, please, hey, please, leave me my red joystick
Leave me my red joystick, leave me my red joystick
Leave me my red joystick
Eve drank apple cider, Eve brewed good apple wine
Eve cooked up stewed apples, knew how to have a good time
She came into the bedroom, raised her skirts up high
she said, "If a little knowledge is a dangerous thing, baby
give me a piece before I die"
Hey, Eve take a bite of my apple
I know you think you're pretty slick
the one thing I ask you to leave me is my red joystick
My red joystick, ooohhh, my red joystick
all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
My red joystick, baby, my red joystick
all I'm asking you leave me is my little red joystick
My red joystick
hey ..., my red joystick
Ooohhh, red joystick
please, leave me my red joystick
... red joystick
please, leave me my red joystick
My red joystick
...
(My red joystick, my red joystick)
If you gave up major vices
you're between a hard place and a wall
And your car breaks down in traffic
on the street
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
baby, turn to me
If your father is free basing
and your mother turning tricks
That's still no reason
you should have a rip
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
turn to me
When your teeth are ground down to the bone
and there's nothing between your legs
And some friend died of something
that you can't pronounce, ah
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
hey baby, you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
turn to me
You can't pay your rent, your boss is an idiot
and your apartment has no heat
And your wife says, "Maybe
it's time to have a child"
Remember, I'm the one who loves you
and you can always give me a call
Turn to me, turn to me
turn to me
When it's all too much you turn the TV set on
and light a cigarette
And then a public service announcement
comes creeping on
And you see a lung corroding
or a fatal heart attack
Turn to me, turn to me
baby, turn to me, I'm just a phone call away
Turn to me, turn to me
hey, turn to me, one .... a dollar
Turn to me, baby
turn to me
(Turn to me, turn to me
turn to me)
(Turn to me, turn to me
turn to me)
I don't like guilt be it stoned or stupid
drunk and disorderly I ain't no cupid
Two years ago today I was arrested on Christmas Eve
I don't want pain, I want to walk not be carried
I don't want to give it up, I want to stay married
I ain't no dog tied to a parked car
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations
I want the principles of a timeless muse
I want to eradicate my negative views
And get rid of those people who are always on a down
It's easy enough to tell what is wrong
but that's not what I want to hear all night long
Some people are like human tuinals
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations
Talkin' 'bout some new sensations
Talkin' a new sensations
I took my GPZ out for a ride
the engine felt good between my thighs
The air felt cool, it's was forty degrees outside
I rode to Pennsylvania near the Delaware Gap
sometimes I got lost and had to check the map
I stopped at a roadside diner for a burger and a coke
There were some country folk and some hunters inside
somebody got themselves married and somebody died
I went to the juke box and played a hillbilly song
They was arguing about football as I waved and went outside
and I headed for the mountains feeling warm inside
I love that GPZ so much, you know that I could kiss her
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, ooohhh, new sensations
Talkin' 'bout your new sensations
Talkin' new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations
Ooohhh, new sensations

The other night we went to see sam's play
Doin' the things that we want to
It was very physical it held you to the stage
Doin' the things that he wants to
Doin' the things that he wants to
The guy's a cowboy from some rodeo
Doin' the things that he wants to
The girl had once loved him, but now she want to go
Doin' the things that she wants to
Doin' the things that she wants to
The man was bullish, the woman was a tease
Doin' the things that they want to
They fought with their words, their bodies and their deeds
Doin' the things that they want to
When they finished fighting, they exited the stage
Doin' the things that they want to
I was firmly struck by the way they had behaved
Doin' the things that they want to
Doin' the things that they want to
Hey
It reminds me of the movies marty made about new york
(doin' the things that he wants to)
Those frank and brutal movies that are so brilliant
(doin' the things that he wants to)
"true love" meet "the raging bull"
(doin' the things that he wants to)
They're very inspirational, I love the things they do
(doin' the things that he wants to)
Doin' the things that I want to
There's not much you hear on the radio today
(doin' the things that we want to)
But you could still see a movie or a play
(doin' the things that we want to)
Here's to "travis bickle" and here's "johnny boy"
(doin' the things that we want to)
Growing up in the mean streets of new york
(doin' the things that we want to)
I wrote this song 'cause I'd like to shake your hand
(doin' the things that we want to)
In a way you guys are the best friends I ever had
(doin' the things that we want to)
Doin' the things that we want to
That we want to
A true love
What becomes a legend most
when she's alone in a hotel lobby
What becomes a legend most
some bad champagne and some foreign bottled beer
What becomes a legend most
when the musicians have come and then leave her
What becomes a legend most
besides being a legendary star
What becomes a legend most
lying in bed cold and regal
What becomes a legend most
lying in bed watching a talk show on TV
What becomes a legend most
fifty days in fifty cities
And everyone says she looks pretty
at least as pretty as a legend should
Fifty days can wear you down
fifty cities flying by
A different man in each different hotel
and if you're not careful, word can get around
What becomes a legend most
not a bed, that is half empty
Not a heart, that is left empty
that's not pretty, not pretty at all
What becomes a legend most
when she's lying in her hotel room
What becomes a legend most
well baby, tonight it's you (tonight it's you)
Baby, tonight it's you
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) maybe tomorrow
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la) Baby, it's you
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(What becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
(what becomes a legend most, sha-la-la-la-la)
I would not run from the holocaust
I would not run from the bomb
I'd welcome the chance to meet my maker
and fly into the sun
Fly into the sun
fly into the sun
I'd break up into million pieces
and fly into the sun
I would not run from the blazing light
I would not run from its rain
I'd see it as an end to misery
as an end to worldly pain
An end to worldly pain
an end to worldly pain
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment
to end this worldly pain
And fly into the sun
fly into the sun
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment
and fly into the sun
The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking
the stars split to their core
And every proton and unnamed neutron
is fusing in my bones
And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising
as man burns from his tomb
And I look at this as a blissful moment
to fly into the sun
Fly into the sun
fly into the sun
I'd burn up into a million pieces
and fly into the sun
To end this mystery
answer my mystery
I'd look at this as a wondrous moment
to end this mystery
Fly into the sun
fly into the sun
I'd break up into a million pieces
and fly into the sun
Read in the paper 'bout a man killed with a sword
and that made my think of my friend George
People said the man was five foot six
sounds like George with his killing stick
Hey bro, what's the word
talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
talkin' 'bout my friend George
You talkin' 'bout my friend George
I knew George since he's eight
I always thought that he was great
And anything that George would do
you know that I would do it too
George liked music and George liked to fight
he worked out in a downtown gym every night
I'd spar with him when work was done
we split lips but it was all in fun
Hey bro, what's the word
you talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
talkin' 'bout my friend George
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Next thing I hear George's got this stick
he's using it for more than kicks
I seen him down at Smalley's bar
he was wired up, I tried to calm him down
Avenge yourself he says to me
avenge yourself for humanity
Avenge yourself for the weak and the poor
stick it to these guys right through their heads
Well, the fight is my music, the stick is my sword
and you know that I love you, so please don't say a word
Can't you hear the music playing, the anthem, it's my call
and the last I seen of George was him
running through the door, I says -
Hey bro, what's the word
talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
you talkin' 'bout my friend George
Talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
you talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
what me saying 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
hear you talkin' 'bout my friend George
Hey bro, what's the word
I hear talkin' 'bout my friend George

Down at the arcade the defender is there
Down off of Broadway he's there playing his games
It's very dangerous putting money down on Robotron
Oh, I'm the Great Defender
And I really know just how to get along
Down at the arcade
Oh, I'm the Great Defender
And I really think I've got it made
A fistful of quarters, a fifty dollar stake
Life is a gamble on Videotape
I called a disc jockey to dedicate a song to Blair
It's the 'Four Tops' singing 'I'll be there'
Down at the arcade ...
The president called to give me the news
I've been awarded the Nobel Price in rhythm and blues
And Stevie Wonder wants to record one of my songs
Oh, I'm the Great Defender
And I really know just how to get along
Oh, I'm the Great Defender, listen to my song
I really hope you like it, it isn't very long
It's rooted in the fifties but its heart's in 1984
And if you really like it
Then I sing it for you once more
Down at the arcade ...
When I was six, I had my first lady
When I was eight, my first drink
When I was fourteen, I was speeding in the streets
What could anybody say to me?
You can call me Mister, you can call me Sir
But don't you point your finger at me
I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want a mistrial in front of the people
I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want to bring my case to the people of New York City
When I was thirty, my attitude was bad
If I said differently it'd be a lie
But there's some smarts you learn down in the street
That a college education can't buy
You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
But don't you point your finger at me, oh
Oh, I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want a mistrial in front of the people
I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want to bring my case to in front of the people at New York City
You can call me Mister, or you can call me Sir
But don't you point your finger at me, yeah
I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want a mistrial in front of the people, I, I
I want a mistrial to clear my name
I want to bring my case to the people at New York City
And I said "M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L", mistrial
In front of all the people
I said "M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L", mistrial
In front of the people of New York City
Mistrial
.... the people of New York City
I said mistrial
"M-I-S-T-R-I-A-L"
I know you're disappointed in the way I handled things
You're thinking I misread the times and acted cowardly
And since what I do affects us both
And you feel that I let you down
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
Lovers trust, no money down
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
It's a lovers trust, no money down
(Hey! lover)
(Hey! lover)
(lover)
They say there's someone for everyone
And for everyone a someone
And some tattoo roses across their chests
With a heart that says Rollo
And some work without a Public Relations man
And do their best work, baby, out of sight
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
Lovers trust, no money down
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
Lovers trust, no money down
(Hey! lover)
(Hey! lover)
(lover)
Now I have known a hero or two
And they all learn to swim through mud
And they all got boots caked with dirty soles
That they get from Squashing bugs
So when push comes to shove get the Harley revved up
The moon can eclipse even the sun
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
Lovers trust, no money down
You're paying a price when there is no price to pay
Lovers trust, no money down
(Hey! lover)
(Hey! lover)
(lover)
Lovers trust, No Money Down (Hey! lover)
Yes, lovers trust, No Money Down (Hey! lover)
Lovers trust, No Money Down (Hey! hey! lover)
Lovers trust, No Money Down (Hey! hey! lover)
(Hey! hey! lover)
(Hey! hey! lover)
...
Outside the world's a mindless child, outside
Outside reflects the worst of styles, outside
Inside when you're in my arms
A mindless child is still to be born
Inside, baby, when we come inside
Outside the politics of greed, outside
Outside misbehavior seethes, outside
Mindless repression dominates the street
While I kneel down and kiss your feet
Inside, baby, when we come inside
Outside
Outside they don't think they breed, outside
Outside emotion determines need, outside
Outside the world's a mindless child
That we could bring to life in your arms
Inside, baby, when we come inside
Outside the politics of hate an greed, outside
Outside the world's a mindless child, outside
But when I hold you in my arms
It's a mindless child that you want
Inside, no matter 'bout the world outside
Inside, a baby's what you want inside
I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
But please don't turn your back
Sometimes I get so upset
But I take it all back
Please don't go, I know I was wrong
Sometimes I don't know what comes over me
But I try to remember
Don't hurt a woman
Don't hurt a woman
I was angry, I said things I shouldn't say
I must have lost control
Sometimes something clicks in my head
And I'm not myself anymore
That wasn't me, you can't believe everything you see
Let's make believe I never said a word
And I'll try to remember
Don't hurt a Woman
Try to remember
Don't hurt a Woman
Try to remember
Don't hurt a Woman
I'll try to remember
Don't hurt a Woman
'Cause I been lovin' you so long
The currents rage deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
Up in the morning, drinking his coffee
Turns on the TV to some slasher movie
Cartoon-like women, tied up and sweaty
Painting and screaming, thank you, have a nice day
The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
His heart is pounding he switches the channel
looking for something other than rape or murder
Or beatings or torture but except for Walt Disney
It's a twisted alliance, this age of video violence
The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
Down at his job, his boss sits there screaming
If he loses his job, then life loses its meaning
His son is in high school, there's nothing he's learning
He sits by the TV, watching Corvettes exploding, 'cause
The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Down at a bar some woman is topless
she's acned and scarred, her hair is a mess
While he shoves 5 dollars down her exotic panties
the video jukebox is, ah, playing Madonna
While just down the block at some local theater
they're grabbing their crotches at the 13th beheading
As the dead rise to live, the live sink to die
the currents are deep and raging inside
The currents rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
No age of reason is landing upon us
This is the age of video violence
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Our good working stiff looks a whore in the eye ties her to a bed
while he beats her back bloody and then back -
At home, drinking more instant coffee
Calls some red-neck evangelist that he's seen on TV and says
The currents rage, the dawn's upon us
This is the age of video violence
The current rage so deep inside us
This is the age of video violence
The currents rage so deep down inside us
This is the age of video violence
No age of reason is landing upon us
This is the age of video violence
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na
Na-na-na, na-na-na

If there's rage inside you so you cannot think, spit it out
If you get so angry that you cannot speak, spit it out
Talk to him or her or it
And tell them where they can put it
Spit it out, spit it out
You got to talk to him or her or it
And take aim with your mouth and spit
Spit it out, spit it out
If you get worked over at your job, spit it out
If a taxi almost runs you down, spit it out
You got to take aim with your mouth and speak
And give it to them right between the teeth
Spit it out, spit it out
Talk to him or her or it
And take aim with your mouth and spit
Spit it out, spit it out
Spit it out
Hey, hey, hey
If you're patient and you have the time, spit it out
Wait till they're on the decline, spit it out
The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft
The Yin with the Yang, the down with the up, oh
Spit it out, spit it out
You got to grab that dumb he, she or it
And give it to them right between the teeth
Spit it out, spit it out
Spit it out, babe, spit it out
Hey
I was sittin' home on the West End
watchin' cable TV with a female friend
we were watchin' the news, the world's in a mess
the poor and the hungry, a world in distress
Herpes, AIDS, the Middle East at full throttle
better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
and while you're at it, check what's in the batter
make sure that candy's in the Original Wrapper
Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
make sure that candy's in the Original Wrapper
Reagan says abortion's murder
while he's looking at Cardinal O'Connor
look at Jerry Falwell Louis Farrakhan
both talk religion and the brotherhood of man
They both sound like they belong in Teheran
watch out, they're goin' full throttle
better check that sausage, before you stick it in the waffle
and while you're at it better check, what's in the batter
make sure that candy's in the Original Wrapper
Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
make sure that candy's in the Original Wrapper
White against white, Black against Jew
it seems like it's 1942
the baby sits in front of MTV
watching violent fantasies
While Dad guzzles beer with his favorite sport
only to find his heroes are all coked up
classic, original, the same old story
the politics of hate in a new surrounding
Hate if it's good and hate if it's bad
and if this all don't make you mad
I'll keep yours and I'll keep mine
nothing sacred and nothing divine
Father, bless me, we're at full throttle
better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
and while you're at it better check that batter
make sure the candy's in the Original Wrapper
Hey, pitcher, better check that batter
make sure that candy's in the Original Wrapper, hey, hey
I was born in the United States
and I grew up hard but I grew up straight
I saw a lack of morals and a lack of concern
a feeling that there's nowhere to turn
Yippies, Hippies and upwardly mobile Yuppies
don't treat me like I'm some dumb lackey
'cause the murderer lives while the victims die
I'd much rather see it an eye for an eye
A heart for a heart, a brain for a brain
and if this all makes you feel a little insane
kick up your heels, turn the music up loud
pick up your guitar and look out at the crowd, and say, -
"Don't mean to come on sanctimonious
but life's got me nervous and little pugnacious
Lugubrious so I give a salutation
and rock on out to beat really stupid
Ohh, poop, ah, doo and how do you do
hip hop gonna bop till I drop"
watch out world, comin' at you full throttle
better check that sausage, before you put it in the waffle
and while you're at it better check that batter
make sure the candy's in the Original Wrapper
Hey, hey, pitcher, better check that batter
make sure the candy's in the Original Wrapper
hey, pitcher, better check that batter
make sure the candy's in the Original Wrapper, hey, hey, hey
Mama's got a lover
A painter I am told
She's getting out of real estate
For the art scene down in old Soho
Art scene down in old Soho
Mama's got a lover
He owns a gallery
she says he likes collages but
the money's in graffiti
Money's in graffiti
Mama's got a lover
I met him yesterday
She says she hopes I like him
Maybe I'll send him a card on father's day
Father's day
Mama's got a lover
they're backing a film
it's about a working mother
who gives birth to black and white Siamese twins
Black and white Siamese twins
Mama's got a lover
he's got something to say
he says he's into dirt and rot
The essence of "urban decay"
"Urban decay"
Mama's got a lover
I met him yesterday
She says she hopes I like him
Maybe I'll send him a card on father's day
Father's day
Mama's got a lover
I met him yesterday
she's starting a new chapter
I wish she was on the last page
The last page
Mama's got a lover
I met him yesterday
She says she hopes I like him
Maybe I'll send him a card on father's day
Father's day
Mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover), oh
Mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
my mama's got a lover (Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
(Mama's got a lover)
I remember you, I remember me
I remember, I remember how things used to be
I remember every word that you said
I remember, how could I forget?
Yes I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember)
I remember you
I remember your old address
And I remember, how could I forget?
I remember thinking how my luck changed
I remember being so amazed
I remember, I remember you (I remember, I remember)
I remember, I remember you (I remember, I remember)
I remember you, I remember me
I remember the way things used to be
I remember how it was that we met
I remember, I will never forget
I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember)
I remember, I remember you
(I remember, I remember)
...
I was staring through a telescope at night
at a large light in the sky
Its spinning lights reminded me of you
A star spinning in orbit lighting up the sky
Or maybe it was not a star at all
I was standing by the Hudson River's edge at night
Looking out across the Jersey shore
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name
And I thought your name should be dancing
beamed from satellites
Larger than any billboard in Times Square
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
NYC lovers, tell it to your heart
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)
I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.
I guess I couldn't sleep
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week
Maybe I should wake you up
But by then it might be gone
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky
I ran outside down a darkened street
Listening to my boot heels click
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette
When I turned the corner
My spinning light was in the street
They were filming a commercial on TV
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
NYC Lovers, tell it to your heart
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart) Tell it to your heart
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart) Tell it to your heart
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid
Tell it to your heart)
Caught between the twisted stars
The plotted lines the faulty map
That brought Columbus to New York
Betwixt between the East and West
He calls on her wearing a leather vest
The earth squeals and shudders to a halt
A diamond crucifix in his ear
Is used to help ward off the fear
That he has left his soul in someone's rented car
Inside his pants he hides a mop
To clean the mess that he has dropped
Into the life of lithesome Juliette Bell
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
And Romeo wanted Juliette
And Juliette wanted Romeo
Romeo Rodriguez squares
His shoulders and curses Jesus
Runs a comb through his black pony-tail
He's thinking of his lonely room
The sink that by his bed gives off a stink
Then smells her perfume in his eyes
And her voice was like a bell
Outside the streets were steaming
The crack dealers were dreaming
Of an Uzi someone had just scored
I betcha I could hit that light
With my one good arm behind my back
Says little Joey Diaz
Brother give me another tote
Those downtown hoods are no damn good
Those Italians need a lesson to be taught
This cop who died in Harlem
You think they'd get the warnin'
I was dancing when I saw his brains run out on the street
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
And Romeo had Juliette
And Juliette had her Romeo
I'll take Manhattan in a garbage bag
With Latin written on it that says
"It's hard to give a shit these days"
Manhattan's sinking like a rock
Into the filthy Hudson what a shock
They wrote a book about it
They said it was like ancient Rome
The perfume burned his eyes
Holding tightly to her thighs
And something flickered for a minute
And then it vanished and was gone
There's a down town fairy singing out "Proud Mary"
As she cruises Christopher Street
And some Southern Queen is acting loud and mean
Where the docks and the Badlands meet
This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you
There's a Greta Garbo and an Alfred Hitchcock
And some black Jamaican stud
There's five Cinderellas and some leather drags
I almost fell into my mug
There's a Crawford, Davis and a tacky Cary Grant
And some Homeboys lookin' for trouble down here from the Bronx
But there ain't no Hairy and no Virgin Mary
You won't hear those voices again
And Johnny Rio and Rotten Rita
You'll never see those faces again
This Halloween is something to be sure
Especially to be here without you
There's the Born Again Losers and the Lavender Boozers
And some crack team from Washington Heights
The boys from Avenue B and the girls from Avenue D
A Tinkerbell in tights
This celebration somehow gets me down
Especially when I see you're not around
There's no Peter Pedantic saying things romantic
In Latin, Greek or Spic
There's no Three bananas or Brandy Alexander
dishing all their tricks
It's a different feeling that I have today
Especially when I know you've gone away
There's a girl from Soho with a teeshirt saying "I Blow"
She's with the "jive five 2 plus 3"
And the girls for pay dates are giving cut rates
Or else doing it for free
The past keeps knock, knock, knocking on my door
And I don't want to hear it anymore
No consolations please for feelin' funky
I got to get my head above my knees
But it makes me mad and mad makes me sad
And then I start to freeze
In the back of my mind I was afraid it might be true
In the back of my mind I was afraid that they meant you
The Halloween Parade
At the Halloween parade
At the Halloween parade
See you next year, at the Halloween parade
Pedro lives out of the Wilshire Hotel
He looks out a window without glass
And the walls are made of cardboard, newspapers on his feet
And his father beats him 'cause he's too tired to beg
He's got 9 brothers and sisters
They're brought up on their knees
It's hard to run when a coat hanger beats you on the thighs
Pedro dreams of being older and killing the old man
But that's a slim chance
He's going to the boulevard
He's gonna end up on the dirty boulevard
He's going out to the dirty boulevard
He's going down to the dirty boulevard
This room cost $2,000 a month
You can believe it, man, it's true
Somewhere there's a landlord's laughing till he wets his pants
No one dreams of being a doctor or a lawyer or anything
They dream of dealing on the dirty boulevard
Give me your hungry, your tired, your poor I'll piss on 'em
That's what the Statue of Bigotry says
Your poor huddled masses
Let's club 'em to death
And get it over with and just dump 'em on the boulevard
Get 'em out on the dirty boulevard
Goin' out to the dirty boulevard
They're going down on the dirty boulevard
Goin' out
Outside it's a bright night
There's an opera at Lincoln Center
Movie stars arrive by limousine
The klieg lights shoot up over the skyline of Manhattan
But the lights are out on the mean streets
A small kid stands by the Lincoln Tunnel
He's selling plastic roses for a buck
The traffic's backed up to 39th Street
The TV whores are calling the cops out for a suck
And back at the Wilshire, Pedro sits there dreaming
He's found a book on Magic in a garbage can
He looks at the pictures
And stares up at the cracked ceiling
"At the count of 3," he says,
"I hope I can disappear."
And fly, fly away from this dirty boulevard
I want to fly from the dirty boulevard
I want to fly from the dirty boulevard
I want to fly-fly-fly-fly from the dirty boulevard
I want to fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
Fly, fly away
Fly, fly away
Fly, fly away
Fly, fly away
I want to fly
The bias of the father runs on through the son
And leaves him bothered and bewildered
The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit
At the face staring back in the mirror
How can he tell a good act from the bad?
He can't even remember his name
How can he do what needs to be done
When he's a follower and not a leader?
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl
Leaving her small and helpless
Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun
Leaving her running in circles
How can she tell a good act from the bad
When she's flat on her back in her room?
How can she do what needs to be done
When she's a coward and a bleeder?
The man if he marries will batter his child
And have endless excuses
The woman sadly will do much the same
Thinking that it's right and it's proper
Better than their mommy or their daddy did
Better than the childhood they suffered
The truth is they're happier when they're in pain
In fact, that's why they got married
This is no time for celebration
This is no time for shaking Hands
This is no time for backslapping
this is no time for marching Bands
This is no time for optimism
this is no time for endless Thought
This is no time for my country Right or Wrong
Remember what that brought
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
This is no time for congratulations
This is no time to turn Your Back
This is no time for circumlocution
This is no time for learned speech
This is no time to count Your Blessings
This is no time for private Gain
This is the time to put Up or Shut Up
It won't come back this way again
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
This is no time to swallow Anger
This is no time to ignore Hate
This is no time to be Acting Frivolous
Because the time is getting late
This is no time for private vendettas
This is no time to not know who you are
Self knowledge is a dangerous thing
The freedom of who you are
This is no time to ignore Warnings
This is no time to clear the Plate
Let's not be sorry after the fact
And let the past become out fate
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
This is no time to turn away and drink
Or smoke some vials of crack
This is a time to gather force
And take dead aim and attack
This is no time for celebration
This is no time for saluting Flags
This is no time for inner Searchings
The future is at hand
This is no time for phony Rhetoric
This is no time for political Speech
This is a time for action
Because the future's within Reach
This is the time
This is the time
This is the time
Because there is no time
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
There is no time
They say he didn't have an enemy
His was a greatness to behold
He was the last surviving progeny
The last one on this side of the world
He measured a half mile from tip to tail
Silver and black with powerful fins
They say he could split a mountain in two
That's how we got the Grand Canyon
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes
Some say they saw him off of Florida
My mother said she saw him in Chinatown
But you can't always trust your mother
Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day
The lighthouse glows ghostly there at night
The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayor's son
And he'd been on death row since 1958
The mayor's kid was a rowdy pig
Spit on Indians and lots worse
The old chief buried a hatchet in his head
Life compared to death for him seemed worse
The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing
And tried to conjure up a storm or rain
The harbor parted, the great whale sprang full up
And caused a huge tidal wave
The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief
The tribe let out a roar
The whites were drowned, the browns and reds set free
But sadly one thing more
Some local yokel member of the NRA
Kept a bazooka in his living room
And thinking he had the chief in his sights
Blew the whale's brains out with a lead harpoon
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Last great American whale
Well Americans don't care for much of anything
Land and water the least
And animal life is low on the totem pole
With human life not worth more than infected yeast
Americans don't care too much for beauty
They'll shit in a river, dump battery acid in a stream
They'll watch dead rats wash up on the beach
And complain if they can't swim
They say things are done for the majority
Don't believe half of what you see and none of what you hear
It's like what my painter friend Donald said to me,
"Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they're done"
It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around
A little me to fill up with my thoughts
A little me or he or she to fill up with my dreams
A way of saying life is not a loss
I'd keep the tyke away from school and tutor him myself
Keep him from the poison of the crowd
But then again pristine isolation might not be the best idea
It's not good trying to immortalize yourself
Beginning of a great adventure
Beginning of a great adventure
Why stop at one, I might have ten, a regular TV brood
I'd breed a little liberal army in the wood
Just like these redneck lunatics I see at the local bar
with their tribe of mutant inbred piglets with cloven hooves
I'd teach 'em how to plant a bomb, start a fire, play guitar
And if they catch a hunter, shoot him in the nuts
I'd try to be as progressive as I could possibly be
As long as I don't have to try too much
Beginning of a great adventure
Beginning of a great adventure
Susie, Jesus, Bogart, Sam, Leslie, Jill and Jeff
Rita, Winny, Andy, Fran and Jet
Boris, Bono, Lucy, Ethel, Bunny, Reg and Tom
That's a lot of names to try not to forget
Carrie, Marlon, Mo and Steve, La Rue and Jerry Lee
Eggplant, Rufus, Dummy, Star and The Glob
I'd need a damn computer to keep track of all these names
I hope this baby thing don't go too far
I hope it's true what my wife said to me
I hope it's true what my wife said to me, hey
I hope it's true what my wife said to me
She says, "Baby, it's the beginning of a great adventure
Babe, beginning of a great adventure"
Take a look
It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around
Create in my own image like a god
I'd raise my own pallbearers to carry me to my grave
And keep me company when I'm a wizened toothless clod
Some gibbering old fool sitting all alone drooling on his shirt
Some senile old fart playing in the dirt
It might be fun to have a kid I could pass something on to
Something better than rage, pain, anger and hurt
I hope it's true what my wife said to me
I hope it's true what my wife said to me
I hope it's true what my wife said to me
She says, "Lou, it's the beginning of a great adventure
Lou, Lou, Lou, beginning of a great adventure"
She says, babe, how you call your lover boy
Sylvia, quite you call your lover man
You can't depend on your family
You can't depend on your friends
You can't depend on a beginning
You can't depend on an end
You can't depend on intelligence
Ooh, you can't depend on God
You can only depend on one thing
You need a busload of faith to get by, watch, baby
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
You need a busload of faith to get by
You can depend on the worst always happening
You can depend on a murderer's drive
You can bet that if he rapes somebody
There'll be no trouble having a child
You can bet that if she aborts it
Pro-lifers will attack her with rage
You can depend on the worst always happening
You need a busload of faith to get by, yeah
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by, baby
Busload of faith to get by
You can't depend on the goodly hearted
The goodly hearted made lamp-shades and soap
You can't depend on the Sacrament
No Father, no Holy Ghost
You can't depend on any churches
Unless there's real estate that you want to buy
You can't depend on a lot of things
You need a busload of faith to get by, woh
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by, baby
Busload of faith to get by
You can't depend on no miracle
You can't depend on the air
You can't depend on a wise man
You can't find 'em because they're not there
You can depend on cruelty
Crudity of thought and sound
You can depend on the worst always happening
You need a busload of faith to get by, ha
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
Busload of faith to get by
I was up in the morning with the TV blarin'
Brush my teeth sittin' watchin' the news
All the beaches were closed the ocean was a Red Sea
But there was no one there to part in two
There was no fresh salad because there's hypos in the cabbage
Staten Island disappeared at noon
And they say the midwest is in great distress
And NASA blew up the moon
The ozone layer has no ozone anymore
And you're gonna leave me for the guy next door
I'm Sick of You
I'm Sick of You
They arrested the Mayor for an illegal favor
Sold the Empire State to Japan
And Oliver North married William Secord
And gave birth to a little Teheran
And the Ayatollah bought a nuclear warship
If he dies he wants to go out in style
And there's nothing to eat that don't carry the stink
Of some human waste dumped in the Nile
We one thing is certainly true
No one here knows what to do
And I'm Sick of You
I'm Sick of You
The radio said there were 400 dead
In some small town in Arkansas
Some whacked out trucker drove into a nuclear reactor
And killed everybody he saw
Now he's on Morton Downey and he's glowing and shining
Doctors say this is a medical advance
They say the bad makes the good and there's something to be learned
In every human experience
Well I know one thing that really is true
This here's a zoo and the keeper ain't you
And I'm sick of it
I'm Sick of you
They ordained the Trumps and then he got the mumps
And died being treated at Mt. Sinal
And my best friend Bill died from a poison pill
Some wired doctor prescribed for stress
My arms and legs are shrunk the food all has lumps
they discovered some animal no one's ever seen
It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire
after running over Rudy Giuliani
They say the President's dead but no one can find his head
it's been missing now for weeks
But no one noticed it he had seemed so fit
and I'm Sick of it
I'm Sick of You
I'm so Sick of You, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye
There's blacks with knives and whites with clubs
Fighting in Howard Beach
There's no such thing as human rights
When you walk the N.Y.streets
A cop was shot in the head by a 10 years old kid
Named Buddah in Central Park last week
The fathers and daughters are lined up by the coffins
By the Statue of Bigotry, hey
You better hold on
Something's happening here
You better hold on
Well, I meet you in Tompkins Square
The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend
They shot him in the car where he sat
And Eleanor Bumpers and Michael Stewart
Must have appreciated that
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague
Of bloody vials washing up on the beach
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson
To heal this bloody breach, hey, hey
You better hold on
something's happening here
You better hold on
I'm gonna meet you in Tompkins Square
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer
she'll never dance but the baby was saved
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel
and he doesn't remember a thing
They shot that old lady 'cause they thought she was a witness to
a crime she didn't even see
Whose home is the home of the brave
by the Statue of Bigotry, hey
You better hold on
something's happening here
You better hold on
meet you in Tompkins Square
You got a black .38 and a gravity knife
you still have to ride the train
There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there
but you ain't no Bernard Goetz, ah
There's no Mafia lawyer to fight in your corner
for that 15 minutes of fame
The have and the have nots are bleeding in the tub
that's New York's future not mine, oh
You better hold on
something's happening here
You better hold on
you better, something's happening here
Hold on, ooohhh, babe
Good evening Mr.Waldheim
And Pontiff how are you?
You have so much in common
In the things you do
And here comes Jesse Jackson
He talks of Common Ground
Does that Common Ground include me
Or is it just a sound?
A sound that shakes
Oh Jesse, you must watch the sounds you make
A sound that quakes
There are fears that still reverberate
Jesse you say Common Ground
Does that include the PLO?
What about people right here right now
Who fought for you not so long ago?
The words that flow so freely
falling dancing from  your lips
I hope that you don't cheapen them
with a racist slip
Oh Common Ground
Is Common Ground a word or just a sound?
Common Ground
Remember those civil rights workers buried in the ground
If I ran for President
And once was a member of the Klan
Wouldn't you call me on it
The way I call you on Farrakhan
And Pontiff, pretty Pontiff
Can anyone shake your hand?
Or is it just that you like uniforms
And someone kissing your hand
Or is it true
The Common Ground for me includes you too?
Oh, oh, is it true
The Common Ground for me includes you too?
Good evening Mr.Waldheim
Pontiff how are you?
As you both stroll through the woods at night
I'm thinking thoughts of you
And Jesse you're inside my thoughts
As the rhythmic words subside
My Common Ground invites you in
Or do you prefer to wait outside
Or is it true
The Common Ground for me is without you
Or is it true
The Common Ground for me is without you
Oh is it true
There's no Ground Common enough for me and you
Sam was lyin' in the jungle
agent orange spread against the sky like marmalade
Hendrix played on some foreign jukebox
they were praying to be saved
Those gooks were fierce and fearless
that's the price you pay when you invade
Xmas in February
Sam lost his arm in some border town
His fingers are mixed with someone's crop
If he didn't have that opium to smoke
The pain would never ever stop
Half his friends are stuffed into black body bags
With their names printed at the top
Xmas in February
Sammy was a short order cook
In a short order black and blue collar town
Everybody worked the steel mill
But the steel mill got closed down
He thought if he joined the Army
He'd have a future that was sound
Like no Xmas in February
Sam's staring at the Vietnam Wall
It's been a while now that he's home
His wife and kid have left, he's unemployed
He's a reminder of the war that wasn't won
He's that guy on the street with the sign that reads
"Please help send this Vet home"
But he is home, and there's no Xmas in February
No matter how much he saves
We who have so much to you who have so little
To you who don't have anything at all
We who have so much more than any one man does need
And you who don't have anything at all, ah
Does anybody need another million dollar movie?
Does anybody need another million dollar star?
Does anybody need to be told over and over
Spitting in the wind comes back at you twice as hard?
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman, going straight to hell
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman, yes
Does anyone really need a billion dollar rocket?
Does anyone need a $60,000 car?
Does anyone need another president?
Or the sins of Swaggart parts 6, 7, 8 and 9? Ah
Does anyone need yet another politician
Caught with his pants down and money sticking in his hole?
Does anyone need another racist preacher?
Spittin' in the wind can only do you harm, ooohhh
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman, going straight to hell
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman, yes
Does anyone need another faulty shuttle
Blasting off to the moon, Venus or Mars?
Does anybody need another self-righteous rock singer
Whose nose he says has led him straight to God?
Does anyone need yet another blank skyscraper?
If you're like me I'm sure a minor miracle will do
A flaming sword or maybe a gold ark floating up the Hudson
When you spit in the wind it comes right back at you
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman, going straight to hell
Strawman, going straight to the devil
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman
Strawman
He was lying banged and battered, skewered and bleeding
Talking crippled on the Cross
Was his mind reeling and heaving hallucinating
Fleeing what a loss
The things he hadn't touched or kissed
His senses slowly stripped away
Not like Buddha not like Vishnu
Life wouldn't rise through him again
I find it easy to believe
That he might question his beliefs
The beginning of the Last Temptation
Dime Story Mystery
The duality of nature, Godly nature
Human nature splits the soul
Fully human, fully divine and divided
The great immortal soul
Split into pieces, whirling pieces
Opposites attract
From the front, the side, the back
The mind itself attacks
I know the feeling, I know it from before
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure
Dime Store Mystery, Last Temptation
I was sitting, drumming, thinking, thumping, pondering
The Mysteries of Life
Outside the city shrieking, screaming, whispering
The Mysteries of Life
There's a funeral tomorrow
At St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you
Ah, what must you have been thinking
When you realized the time had come for you
I wish I hadn't thrown away my time
On so much Human and so much less Divine
The end of the Last Temptation
The end of a Dime Store Mystery
When you're growing up in a small town
When you're growing up in a small town
When you're growing up in a small town
You say, "No one famous ever came from here"
When you're growing up in a small town
And you're having a nervous breakdown
And you think that you'll never escape it
Yourself or the place that you live
Where did Picasso come from?
There's no Michelangelo coming from Pittsburgh
If art is the tip of the iceberg
I'm the part sinking below
When you're growing up in a small town
Bad skin, bad eyes, gay and fatty
People look at you funny
When you're in a small town
My father worked in construction
It's not something for which I am suited
Oh, what is something for which you are suited?
Getting out of here
I hate being odd in a small town
If they stare, let them stare in New York City
As this pink-eyed painting albino
How far can my fantasy go?
I'm no Dali coming from Pittsburgh
No adorable lisping Capote, my hero
Oh, do you think I could meet him?
I'd camp out at his front door
There's only one good thing about a small town
There's only one good use for a small town
There's only one good thing about a small town
You know that you want to get out
When you're growing up in a small town
You know that you'll grow down in a small town
There's only one good use for a small town
You hate it - and you know you'll have to leave
Please, come over to 81st Street I'm in the apartment
Above the bar
You know you can't miss it, it's across from the subway
And the tacky store with the Mylar scarves
My skin is as pale as outdoors moon
My hair is silver like a Tiffany watch
I like lots of people around me but don't kiss hello
And please don't touch
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
"The way to make friends Andy, is invite them up for tea."
Open house
Open house
I've got a lot of cats, here's my favorite
She's lady called Sam
I made a paper doll of her, you can have it
That's what I did when I had St. Vitus dance
It's a Czechoslovakian custom my mother passed on to me
Give people little presents so they remember me
Open house
Open house
Someone bring the vegetables
Someone please bring heat
My mother showed up yesterday
We need something to eat
I think I got a job today they want me to draw shoes
The ones I drew were old and used
They told me to draw something new
Open house
Open house
Fly me to the moon
Fly me to a star
But there are no stars in the New York sky
They're all on the ground
You scared yourself with music, I scared myself with paint
I drew 550 different shoes today, it almost made me faint
Open house
Open house
Open house
Open house
You've got the money, I've got the time
You want your freedom, make your freedom mine
Cause I've got the style it takes
And money is all that it takes
You've got connexions and I've got the art
You like my attention and I like your looks
And I have the style it takes and you know the people it takes
Why don't you sit right over there, we'll do a movie portrait
I'll turn the camera on and I won't even be there
A portrait that moves, you look great I think
I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall
For 24 hours glowing on your wall
Watch the sun rise above it in your room
Wallpaper art, a great view
I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art
It's the same one you can buy at any supermarket
Cause I've got the style it takes
And you've got the people it takes
This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground
I show movies on them
Do you like their sound
Cause they have a style that grates and I have art to make
Let's do a movie here next week
We don't have sound but you're so great
You don't have to speak
You've got the style it takes (kiss)
You've got the style it takes (eat)
I've got the style it takes (couch)
We've got the style it takes (kiss)
Andy was a Catholic
The ethic ran through his bones
He lived alone with his mother
Collecting gossip and toys
Every Sunday when he went to Church
He'd kneel in his pew and say
It's work
All that matters is work
He was a lot of things
What I remember most he'd say
I've got to bring home the bacon
Someone's got to bring home the roast
He'd get to the Factory early
If you'd ask him he'd tell you straight out
It's work
No matter what I did it never seemed enough
He said I was lazy, I said I was young
He said, How many songs did you write
I'd written zero, I'd lied and said, Ten
You won't be young forever
You should have written fifteen
It's work
You ought to make things big
People like it that way
And the songs with the dirty words
Make sure your record them that way
Andy liked to stir up trouble
He was funny that way
He said, It's just work
Andy sat down to talk one day
He said decide what you want
Do you want to expand your parameters
Or play museums like some dilettante
I fired him on the spot
He got red and called me a rat
It was the worst word that he could think of
And I've never seen him like that
It's work
I thought he said it's just work
Andy said a lot of things
I stored them all away in my head
Sometimes when I can't decide what I should do
I think what would Andy have said
He'd probably say you think too much
That's cause there's work that you don't want to do
It's work
The most important thing is work
It's work
The most important thing is work
The trouble with a classicist
He looks at a tree
That's all he sees, he paints a tree
The trouble with a classicist
He looks at the sky
He doesn't ask why, he just paints the sky
The trouble with an impressionist
He looks at a log, he doesn't know who he is standing staring at this log
And surrealist memories are too amorphous and proud
While those downtown macho painters are just alcoholic
That's the trouble with impressionists
That's the trouble with impressionists
That's the trouble with impressionists
That's the trouble with impressionists
The trouble with personalities, they're too wrapped up in style
It's too personal, they're in love with their own guile
They're like illegal aliens, trying to make a buck
They're driving gypsy cabs but they're thinking like a truck
That's the trouble with personalities
That's the trouble with personalities
That's the trouble with personalities
That's the trouble with personalities
I like the druggy downtown kids who spraypaint walls and trains
I like their lack of training, their primitive technique
I think sometimes it hurts you when you stay too long in school
I think sometimes it hurts you when you're afraid to be called a fool
That's the trouble with classicists
That's the trouble with classicists
That's the trouble with classicists
That's the trouble with classicists
Starlight open wide, starlight open up your door
This is New York calling with movies on the street
Movies with real people, what you get is what you see
Starlight open wide, Andy's Cecil B. DeMille
Come on L.A. give us a call
We've got superstars who talk, they'll do anything at all
Ingrid, Viva, Little Joe, Baby Jane, and Edie S
But you better call us soon before we talk ourselves to death
Starlight open wide everybody is a star
Split screen 8-hour movies
We've got color, we've got sound
Won't you recognize us, we're everything you hate
Andy loves old Hollywood movies, he'll scare you hypocrites to death
You know that shooting up's for real
That person who's screaming, that's the way he really feels
We're all improvising, five movies in a week
If Hollywood doesn't call us - we'll be sick
Starlight open wide
Do to movies what you did to art
Can you see beauty in ugliness, or is it playing in the dirt
There are stars out on the New York streets
We want to capture them on film
But if no one wants to see them
We'll make another and another
Starlight let us in that magic room
We've all dreamt of Hollywood, it can't happen too soon
Won't you give us a million dollars the rent is due
Andy will give you 2 movies and a painting
Starlight open wide!
Faces and names, I wish they were the same
Faces and names only cause trouble for me
Faces and names
If we all looked the same and we all had the same name
I wouldn't be jealous of you or you jealous of me
Faces and names
I always fall in love with someone who looks
The way I wish that I could be
I'm always staring at someone who hurts
And the one they hurt is me
Faces and names, to me they're all the same
If I looked like you and you looked like me
There'd be less trouble you see
Faces and names I wish they'd go away
I'd disappear into that wall and never talk
Faces and names
I wish I was a robot or a machine
Without a feeling or a thought
People who want to meet the name I have
Are always disappointed when they meet me
Faces and names, I wish they were the same
Faces and names only cause problems for me
Faces and names
I'd rather be a hole in the wall - looking out on the other side
I'd rather look and listen, listen and not talk
To faces and names
If I had a breakdown when I was a kid
If I lost my hair when I was young
If you dress older when you're not, as your really age you look the same
If we all looked the same, we wouldn't play these games
Me dressing for you and you dressing for me - undressing for me
Faces and names if they all were the same
You wouldn't be jealous of me o me jealous of you
Me jealous of you - I'm jealous of you
Your face and your name
Your face and your name
Faces and names
I think images are worth repeating
Images repeated from a painting
Images taken from a painting
From a photo worth re-seeing
I love images worth repeating, project them upon the ceiling
Multiply them with silk screening
See them with a different feeling
Images
Those images
Images
Those images
Some say images have no feeling, I think there's a deeper meaning
Mechanical precision or so it's seeming
Instigates a cooler feeling
I love multiplicity of screenings
Things born anew display new meanings
I think images are worth repeating and repeating and repeating
I'm no urban idiot savant spewing paint without any order
I'm no sphinx, no mystery enigma
What I paint is very ordinary
I don't think I'm old or modern, I don't think I think I'm thinking
It doesn't matter what I'm thinking
It's the images that are worth repeating
Images
Those images
Images
Those images
If you're looking for a deeper meaning, I'm as deep as this high ceiling
If you think technique is meaning, you might find me very simple
You might think that images boring
Cars and cans and chairs and flowers
You might find me personally boring
Hammer, sickle, mao tse tong, mao tse tong
I think that it bears repeating the images upon the ceiling
I love images worth repeating and repeating and repeating
Images
Those images
Images
Those images
People said to lock the door and have an open house no more
The said the factory must change and slowly slip away
But if I have to live in fear, where will I get my ideas
With all those crazy people gone, will I slowly slip away
Still there's no more Billy Name, and Ondine is not the same
Wonton and the turtle gone
Slowly slip away...slowly slip away
If I close the factory door and don't see those people anymore
If I give in to infamy...I'll slowly slip away
I know it seems that friends are right
Hello daylight, goodbye night
But starlight is so quiet here, think I'll slowly slip away
What can I do by myself, it's good to here from someone else
It's good to hear a crazy voice that will not slip away
Will not slip away
If I have to live in fear my ideas will slowly slip away
If I have to live in fear I'm afraid my life will slip away
If you can't see me past my door
Why your thoughts could slowly slip away
If I have to lock the door, another life exists no more
Slip away
Friends have said to lock the door
Watch out for who comes through the door
They said the Factory must change
But I don't
It wasn't me who shamed you, it's not fair to say that
You wanted to work I gave you a chance at that
It wasn't me who hurt you, that's more credit that I'm worth
Don't threaten me with the things you'll do to you
It wasn't me who shamed you, it wasn't me who brought you down
You did it to yourself without any help from me
It wasn't me who hurt you, I showed you possibilities
The problems you had were there before you met me
I didn't say this had to be
You can't blame these things on me
It wasn't , it wasn't me, it wasn't me
I know she's dead, it wasn't me
It wasn't me who changed you, you did it to yourself
I'm not an excuse for the hole you dropped in
I'm not simple minded but I'm not father to you at all
Death exists but you do things to yourself
I never said give up control
I never said stick a needle in your arm and die
It wasn't , it wasn't me, it wasn't me
I know she's dead but it wasn't me
It wasn't me who shamed you, who covered you with mud
You did it to yourself without any help from me
You act as I could've told you or stopped you like some god
But people never listen and you know that that's a fact
I never said slit your wrists and die
I never said throw your life away
It wasn't , it wasn't me, it wasn't me
You're killing yourself - you can't blame me
Valerie Solanas took the elevator got off at the 4th floor
Valerie Solanas took the elevator got off at the 4th floor
She pointed the gun at Andy saying you cannot control me anymore
And I believe there's got to be some retribution
I believe an eye for an eye is elemental
And I believe that something's wrong if she's alive right now
Valerie Solanas took three steps pointing at the floor
Valerie Solanas waved her gun pointing at the floor
From inside her idiot madness spoke and bang
Andy fell onto the floor
And I believe life's serious enough for retribution
I believe being sick is no excuse and
I believe I would've pulled the switch on her myself
When they got him to the hospital his pulse was gone
They thought that he was dead
His guts were pouring from his wounds onto the floor
They thought that he was dead
Not until years later would the hospital do to him what she could not
Andy said, "Where were you, you didn't come to see me"
Andy said, "I think I died, why didn't you come to see me"
Andy said, "It hurt so much, they took blood from my hand"
I believe there's got to be some retribution
I believe there's got to be some retribution
I believe we are all the poorer for it now
Visit me, why didn't you visit me
Visit me, why didn't you visit me
I really care a lot
Although I look like I do not
Since I was shot
There's nobody but you
I know I look blase
Party Andy's what the papers say
At dinner I'm the one who pay
For a nobody like you
Nobody but you
Nobody like you
Since I got shot
There's nobody but you
Won't you decorate my house?
I'll sit there quiet as a mouse
You know me, I like to look a lot
At nobody but you
I'll hold your hand and slap my face
I'll tickle you, to your disgrace
Won't you put me in my proper place?
A nobody like you
Sundays I pray a lot
I like to wind you up and paint your clock
I want to be what I am not
For a nobody like you
The bullet split my spleen and lung
The doctor said that I was gone
Inside I've got some shattered bone
For nobody but you
Nobody but you
Nobody like you
Shattered bone
For nobody but you
I'm still not sure I didn't die
And if I'm dreaming I still have bad pains inside
I know I'll never be a bride, to nobody like you
I wish I had a stronger chin
My skin was good, my nose was thin
This is no movie I'd ask to be in
With a nobody like you
Nobody like you
A nobody like you
All my life, it's been nobodies like you
It was a very cold clear fall night
I had a terrible dream
Billy Name and Brigid were playing under my stair case on the second floor about two o'clock in the morning
I woke up because Amos and Archie had started barking
That made me very angry because I wasn't feeling well and I told them I was very cross the real me that they just better remember what happened to Sam the bad cat that was left at home and got sick and went to pussy heaven
It was a very cold clear fall night
Some snowflakes were falling
Gee, it was so beautiful
And so I went to get my camera to take some pictures
And then I was taking the pictures
But the exposure thing wasn't right
And I was going to call Fred or Gerry
To find out how to get set it
I was too late
And then I remembered they were still probably at dinner
And anyway
I felt really bad and didn't want to talk to anybody
But the snowflakes were so beautiful and real looking
And I really wanted to hold them
And that's when I heard the voices
From down the hall near the stairs
So I got a flashlight
And I was scared and I went out into the hallway
There's been all kinds of troubles
Lately in the neighborhood
And someone's got to bring home the bacon and anyway
There were Brigid and Billy playing
And under the stair case
Was a little meadow sort of like the park at 23rd street
Where all the young kids go and play frisbee
Gee, that must be fun
Maybe we should do an article on that in the magazine
But they'll just tell me I'm stupid and it won't sell
But I'll just hold my ground this time, I mean
It's my magazine, isn't it?
So I was thinking that as the snowflakes fell
And I heard those voices having so much fun
Gee, it would be so great to have some fun
So I called Billy
But either he didn't hear me or he didn't want to answer
Which was so strange
Because
Even if I don't like reunions I've always loved Billy
I'm so glad he's working
I mean it's different than Ondine
He keeps touring with those movies
And he doesn't even pay us and the film
I mean the film's just going to disintegrate and then what
I mean he's so normal off of drugs
I just don't get it
And then I saw John Cale
He's been looking really great
He's been coming by the office to exercise with me
Ronnie said I have a muscle
But he's been really mean since he went to AA
I mean what does it mean
When you give up drinking and then you're still so mean
He says I'm being lazy but I'm not
I'm just can't find any ideas
I mean I'm just not
Let's face it
Going to get any ideas up at the office
And seeing John made me think of the Velvets
And I had been thinking about them
When I was on St. Mark's place
Going to that new gallery those sweet new kids have opened
But they thought I was old
And then I saw the old dom
The old club where we did our first shows
It was so great
And I don't understand about that Velvets' first album
I mean I did the cover
I was the producer
And I always see it repackaged
And I've never gotten a penny from it
How could that be
I should call Henry
But it was good seeing john
I did a cover for him
But I did in black and white and he change it to color
It would have been worth more if he'd left it my way
But you can never tell any body anything I've leaned that
I tried calling again to Billy and John
They wouldn't recognize me it was like I wasn't there
Why won't they let me in
And then I saw Lou
I'm so mad at him
Lou Reed got married and didn't invite me
I mean is it because he thought I'd bring too many people
I don't get it
Could have at least called
I mean he's doing so great
Why doesn't he call me?
I saw him at the MTV show
And he was one row away and he didn't even say hello
I don't get it
You know I hate Lou
I really do
He won't even hire us for his videos
And I was proud of him
I was so scared today
There was blood leaking thought my shirt
From those old scars from being shot
And the corset I wear to keep my insides in was hurting
And I did three sets of fifteen pushups
And four sets of ten setups
But then my insides hurt
And I saw drops of blood on my shirt and I remember
The doctors saying I was dead
And then later they had to take blood out of my hand
Cause they ran out of veins
But then
All this thinking was making me an old grouch
And you can't do anything anyway so
If they wouldn't let me play with them in my own dream
I was just going to have to make another
And another
And another
Gee, wouldn't it be funny if I died in this dream
Before I could make another one up
And nobody called
And nobody came
Train entering the city - I lost myself and never come back
Took a trip around the world and never came back
Black silhouettes, crisscrossed tracks never came back
Forever changed, forever changed
You might think I'm frivolous, uncaring and cold
You might think I'm frivolous - depends on your point of view
Society and who paints and records them - the high and the low
I left my all life behind me and never went back
Forever changed, forever changed
Got to get to the city - get a job
Got to get some work to see me through
My old life's disappearing from view
Hong Kong - and I was changed
Burma and India - and I was changed
Only art to see me through
Only heart to see me through
My old life's disappearing, disappearing from my view
Forever changed, forever changed
Brigid and Pat - please see me through
The whole thing quickly receding
My life disappearing - disappearing from view
Forever changed, forever changed
I left my old life behind and was forever changed
Forever changed
Andy, it's me, haven't seen you in a while
I wished I talked to you more when you were alive
I thought you were self assured when you acted shy
Hello, it's me
I really miss you, I really miss your mind
I haven't heard ideas like that for such a long, long time
I loved to watch you draw and watch you paint
But when I saw you last, I turned away
When Billy Name was sick and locked up in his room
You asked me for some speed, I though it was for you
I'm sorry if I doubted your good heart
Things always seem to end before they start
Hello, it's me, it was a great gallery show
Your cow wallpaper and your floating silver pillows
I wish I paid more attention when they laughed at you
Hello, it's me
'Pop goes pop artist', the headline said
'Is shooting a put on, is Warhol really dead?'
You get less time for stealing a car
I remember thinking as I heard my own record in a bar
They really hated you, now all that's changed
But I have some resentments that can never be unmade
You hit me where it hurt, I didn't laugh
Your diaries are not a worthy epitaph
Well, now Andy, I guess we've got to go
I wish someway, somehow, you like this little show
I know this is late in coming, but it's the only way I know
Hello, it's me-
Goodnight Andy
Goodbye Andy
Life's like a mayonnaise soda
And life's like space without room
And life's like bacon and ice cream
That's what life's like without you
Life's like forever becoming
But life's forever dealing in hurt
Now life's like death without living
That's what life's like without you
Life's like Sanskrit read to a pony
I see you in my mind's eye strangling on your tongue
What good is knowing such devotion
I've been around, I know what makes things run
What good is seeing eye chocolate
What good's a computerized nose
And what good was cancer in April
Why no good, no good at all
What good's a war without killing
What good is rain that falls up
What good's a disease that won't hurt you
Why no good, I guess, no good at all
What good are these thoughts that I'm thinking
It must be better, huh not to be thinking at all
A styrofoam lover with emotions of concrete
No not much, not much at all
What's good is life without living
What good's this lion that barks
You loved a life others throw away nightly
It's not fair, not fair at all
What's good?
Oh baby, what's good?
What's good?
What's good?
Not much at all
Hey baby, what's good?
What's good? Life's good
But not fair at all
I was visited by The Power and The Glory
I was visited by a majestic hymn
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
Electricity flowing through my veins
I was captured by a larger moment
I was seized by divinity's hot breath
Gorged like a lion on experience
Powerful from life
I wanted all of it
Not just some of it
All of it
I saw a man turn into a bird
I saw a bird turn into a tiger
I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes
In the jungles of the Amazon
I saw a man put a red hot needle through his eye
Turn into a crow and fly through the trees
Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames
And I wanted this to happen to me
I wanted all of it
All of it, all of it
Not just some of it
All of it
We saw the moon vanish into his pocket
We saw the stars disappear from sight
We saw him walk across water into the sun
While bathed in eternal light
We spewed out questions waiting for answers
Creating legends, religions and myths
Books, stories, movies and plays
All trying to explain this
I want all of it
All of it, all of it
Not just some of it
I saw a great man turn into a little child
The cancer reduced him to dust
His voice growing weak as he fought for his life
With a bravery few men know
I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs
Trying to stop the cancerous spread
And it made me think of Leda and The Swan
And gold being made from lead
The same power that burned Hiroshima
Causing three legged babies and death
Shrunk to the size of a nickel
To help him regain his breath
And I was struck by The Power and The Glory
I was visited by a majestic Him
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky
As the radiation flowed through him
I wanted all of it
Not just some of it
All of it
All of it, all of it, all of it
Magician Magician, take me upon your wings
And gently roll the clouds away
I'm sorry, so sorry, I have no incantations
Only words to help sweep me away
I want some magic to sweep me away
I want some magic to sweep me away
I want to count to five
Turn around and find myself gone
Fly me through the storm and wake up in the calm
Release me from the body
From this bulk that moves beside me
Let me leave this body far away
I'm sick of looking at me
I hate this painful body
That disease has slowly worm away
Magician, take my spirit
Inside I'm young and vital
Inside I'm alive, please take me away
So many things to do, it's too early
For my life to be ending
For this body to simply rot away
I want some magic to keep me alive
I want a miracle, I don't want to die
I'm afraid that if I go to sleep I'll never wake
I'll no longer exist
I'll close my eyes and disappear and float into the mist
Somebody please hear me
My hand can't hold a cup of coffee
My fingers are weak, things just fall away
Inside I'm young and pretty
Too many things unfinished
My very breath taken away
Doctor you're no magician
And I am no believer
I need more than faith can give me now
I want to believe in miracles
Not just belief in numbers
I need some magic to take me away
I want some magic to sweep me away
I want some magic to sweep me away
Visit on this starlit night
Replace the stars, the moon, the light, the sun's gone
Fly me through this storm and wake up in the calm
I fly right through this storm
And I wake up in the calm
I see The Sword of Damocles is right above your head
They're trying a new treatment to get you out of bed
But radiation kills both bad and good, it can not differentiate
So to cure you they must kill you
The Sword of Damocles hangs above your head
Now I have seen lots of peoples die from car crashes or drugs
Last night on 33rd st. I saw a kid get hit by a bus
But this drawn out torture over which part of you lives is very hard to take
To cure you they must kill you
The Sword of Damocles above your head
That mix of morphine and dexedrine, we use it on the street
It kills the pain and keeps you up, your very soul to keep
But this guessing game has its own rules, the good don't always win
And might makes right
The Sword of Damocles is hanging above your head
It seems everything's done that must be done
From over here though things don't seem fair
But there are things that we can't know
Maybe there's something over there
Some other world that we don't know about
I know you hate that mystic shit
It's just another way of seeing
The Sword of Damocles above your head
Sitting on a hard chair try to sit straight
Sitting on a hard chair this moment won't wait
Listening to the speakers, they're talking about you
Look at all the people, all the people you knew
Sitting with my back straight it becomes hard to hear
Some people are crying, it becomes hard to hear
I don't think you'd have liked it, you would have made a joke
You would have made it easier, you'd say "tomorrow I'm smoke"
Sitting on a hard chair how far we have come
Trying hard to listen to your friends who have come
Some of them are famous and some are just like me
Trying hard to listen trying hard to see
Sitting in a hard chair it's over time to stand
Some people are crying, I turn to grab your hand
It's your daughter saying thank you
You, you would have made a joke
"Isn't this something," you'd say, "tomorrow I'm smoke"
Sitting in a hard chair it's over time to stand
Some people are crying, I turn to grab your hand
It's your daughter saying thank you
You, you would have made a joke
"Isn't this something," you'd say, "tomorrow I'm smoke"
Well the coal black sea waits for me, me, me
The coal black sea waits forever
The waves hit the shore crying more, more, more
But the coal black sea waits forever
The tornados come, up the coast they run
Hurricanes rip the sky forever
Through the weathers change, the sea remains the same
The coal black sea waits forever
There are ashes spilt through collective guilt
People rest at sea forever
Since they burnt you up, collect you in a cup
For you the coal black sea has no terror
Will your ashes float like some foreign boat
Or will they sink absorbed forever?
Will the Atlantic Coast have its final boast?
Nothing else contained you ever
Now the coal black sea waits for me, me, me
The coal black sea waits forever
When I leave this joint at some further point
The same coal black sea will it be waiting
If I close my eyes I see your face
And I'm not without you
If I try hard and concentrate
I can still hear you speak
I picture myself in your room by the chair
You're smoking a cigarette
If I close my eyes I can see your face
You're saying, "I missed you"
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
If I close my eyes I can smell your perfume
You look and say, "Hi baby"
If I close my eyes pictures from china
Still hang from the wall
I hear the dog bark I turn and say
"What were you saying? "
I picture you in the red chair
Inside the pale room
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
You sat in your chair with a tube in your arm
You were so skinny
You were still making jokes
I don't know what drugs they had you on
You said, "I guess this is not the time
For long term investments"
You were always laughing
But you never laughing at me
They say in the end the pain was so bad
That you were screaming
Now you were no saint but you deserved
Better than that
From the corner I watched them removing things
From your apartment
But I can picture you red chair and pale room
Inside my head
If I close my eyes I see your face
And I'm not without you
If I try hard and concentrate I can hear your voice saying
"Who better than you"
If I close my eyes I can't believe that
I'm here without you
Inside your pale room your empty red chair
And my head
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
Dreamin', I'm always dreamin'
It must be nice to be steady, it must be nice to be firm
it must be nice never to move off the mark
It must be nice to be dependable and never let anyone down
it must be great to be all the things you're not
It must be great to be all the things that I'm not
I see you in the hospital your humor is intact
I'm embarrassed by the strength I seem to lack
If I was in your shoes, so strange that I am not
I'd fold up in a minute and a half
I'd fold up in a minute and a half
And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
No I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
It must be nice to be normal, it must be nice to be cold
It must be nice not to have to go, oh, up or down
But me I'm all emotional, no matter how I try
You're gone and I'm still here alive
You're gone and I'm still alive
And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
No, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
There are things we say we wish we knew and in fact we never do
But I'd wish I'd known that you were going to die
Then I wouldn't feel so stupid, such a fool that I didn't call
And I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
No there's no logic to this, who's picked to stay or go
If you think too hard it only makes you mad
But your optimism made me think you really had it beat
So I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
No, I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
I didn't get a chance to say goodbye
I wish I was the warrior king in every language that I speak
Lord over all that I survey and all that I see I keep
Power omnipresent, undiminished uncontrolled
With a mass of violent fury at the center of my soul
I wish I was a warrior king, inscrutable benign
With a faceless charging power always at my command
Footsteps so heavy that the world shakes, my rage instilling fear, ah, ha
Yet cautious firm but fair and good, the perfect warrior king
I wish I installed angels in every subject's house
Agents of my goodness no one would be without
A steak on every plate, a car for every house
And if you ever crossed me, I'd have your eyes put out
You don't exist without me, without me you don't exist
And if logic won't convinced you then there's always this
I'm bigger, smarter, stronger, tough; yet sensitive and kind
And though I could crush you like a bug, it would never cross my mind
It wouldn't cross my mind to break your neck or rip out your vicious tongue
It wouldn't cross my mind to snap your leg like a twig or squash you like some slug
You are a violent messenger and I'm not above your taunts
And if you hit me, you know I'll kill you, because I'm the warrior king
Looking in the mirror
Harry didn't like what he saw
The cheeks of his mother, the eyes of his father
As each day crashed around him
The future stood revealed
He was turning into his parents
The final disappointment
Stepping out of the shower
Harry stared at himself
His hairline receding, the slight overbite
He picked up the razor to begin his shaving and thought
"Oh, I wish I was different.
I wish I was stronger
I wish I was thinner
I wish I didn't have this nose
These ears that stick out remind me of my father
And I don't want to be reminded at all."
The final disappointment
Harry looked in the mirror thinking of Vincent Van Gogh
And with a quick swipe lopped off his nose
And happy with that he made a slice where his chin was
He'd always wanted a dimple
The end of all illusion
Then peering down straight between his legs
Harry thought of the range of possibilities
A new face, a new life, no memories of the past
And slit his throat from ear to ear
Harry woke up with a cough
The stitches made him wince
A doctor smiled at him from
Somewhere across the room
"Son, we saved your life
But you'll never look the same."
And when he heard that, Harry had to laugh
And when he heard that, Harry had to laugh
Although it hurt, Harry had to laugh
The final disappointment
Well, you covered your tracks and now I can't see you
You had your ashes scattered at sea
There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at
You were in the NY Times obituary
There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie
Some photographs and some memories
Sometime I dial your phone number by mistake
And this is what I hear
"This is no longer a working number baby
Please redial your call
This is no longer a working number
Your party doesn't live here anymore.
This is no longer a working number
If you still require help
Stay on the line and an operator
Will try to bail you out."
I knew I should have seen you that Thursday
I knew I shouldn't have left
But you sounded so good, your spirits so up
I thought I'd see you next week
I say over and over if I had half a brain
If I had half a brain in my head
I wouldn't sit here dialing a wrong number
And listening to what some recording said
"This is no longer a working number baby
Please redial your call
This is no longer a working number
Your party doesn't live here anymore.
This is no longer a working number
But if you still require help
Stay on the line and an operator
Will try to bail you out."
I knew I should have written, written things down
I always say I'll never forget
Who can forget a one-eye pilot
Who's a concert pianist
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme
My friends are blending in my head
They're melting into one great spirit
And that spirit isn't dead
Now I may not remember everything that you said
But I remember all the things you've done
And not a day goes by, not an hour
When I don't try to be like you
You were gassed, stoked and rarin' to go
And you were that way all the time
So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves
Every time I dial the wrong line
This is no longer a working number baby
This is no longer a working number
Gassed, stoked and ready to go
Gassed, stoked and ready to go
Gassed, stoked and ready to go
Gassed, stoked and ready to go

Cancer reduce him to dust
We saw the moon vanish into his pocket
We saw the stars disappear from sight
We saw him walk across water into the sun
While bathed in eternal light
We spewed out questions, waiting for answers
Creating legends, religions and myths
Books, stories, movies and plays

When you pass through the fire, you pass through humble
You pass through a maze of self doubt
When you pass through humble, the lights can blind you
Some people never figure that out
You pass through arrogance, you pass through hurt
You pass through an ever present past
And it's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light
Pass through the fire to the light
Pass through the fire to the light
It's best not to wait for luck to save you
Pass through the fire to the light
As you pass through the fire, your right hand waving
There are things you have to throw out
That caustic dread inside your head will never help you out
You have to be very strong 'cause you'll start from zero
over and over again
And as the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
Lying straight ahead
Lying straight ahead
Lying straight ahead
As the smoke clears there's an all consuming fire
Lying straight ahead
They say no one person can do it all
But you want to in your head
But you can't be Shakespeare and you can't be Joyce
So what is left instead
You're stuck with yourself and a rage that can hurt you
You have to start at the beginning again
And just this moment
This wonderful fire started up again
When you pass through humble, when you pass through sickly
When you pass through, I'm better than you all
When you pass through anger and self deprecation
And have the strength to acknowledge it all
When the past makes you laugh and you can savor the magic
That let you survive your own war
You find that that fire is passion
And there's a door up ahead, not a wall
As you pass through fire, as you pass through fire
Trying to remember its name
When you pass through fire licking at your lips
You cannot remain the same
And if the building's burning, move towards that door
But don't put the flames out
There's a bit of magic in everything
And then some loss to even things out
Some loss to even things out
Some loss to even things out
There's a bit of magic in everything
And then some loss to even things out
When I was a young man, no bigger than this
a chocolate egg cream was not to be missed
Some U Bet's Chocolate Syrup, seltzer water mixed with milk
you stir it up into a heady fro, tasted just like silk
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
Now you can go to Junior's, Dave's on Canal Street
and I think there's Ken's in Boston
there must be something in L.A.
But Becky's on Kings Highway, was the egg cream of choice
and if you don't believe me, go ask any of the boys
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
The only good thing I have to say about P.S. 92
was the egg cream served at Becky's, it was a fearsome brew
For 50 cents you got a shot, choco bubbles up your nose
that made it easier to deal with knife fights
and kids pissing in the street
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
So the next time you're in Brooklyn, please say hello for me
at Totonno's for Pizza and ice cream at Al and Shirley's
But mostly you go to Becky's, sit in a booth and say hello
and have two chocolate egg cream, one to stay and one to go
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream, ah
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
You scream, I steam, we all want egg cream
It can only lead to trouble if you break my heart
if you accidentally crush it on the ides of March
I'd prefer you were straight forward
you don't have to go through all of that
I'm a New York city man, baby, and say "go" and that is that
New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that
I'm a New York city man, you just say "go" and that is that
It's far too complicated to make up a lie
that you'd have to remember and really why
I wouldn't want to be around you
if you didn't want to have me around
I'm a M-A-N-N man, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone
M-A-N-N man, you blink your eyes, honey, I love you, I'll be gone
New York city man, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone
Brutus made a pretty speech but Caesar was betrayed
Lady Macbeth went crazy but Macbeth ended slain
Ophelia and Desdamona dead leaving Hamlet in a play
but I'm no Lear with blinded eyes, say "go" and I am gone
The stars have shut their eyes up tight
the earth has changed it's course
a Kingdom sits on a black knight's back
as he tries to mount a white jeweled horse
While a clock full of butterflies on the hour
releases a thousand moths
You say "leave" and I'll be gone
without any remorse
No letters faxes phones or tears
there's a difference between bad and worse
I'm a New York city man, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
New York city - man, M-A-N, you blink your eyes and I'll be gone
New York city, I love you, New York city man
New York city, how I love you, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
just a little grain of sand
New York city, ooohhh, how I love you
New York city, baby, blink your eyes and I'll be gone
Oh, how I love you
Wind blows snow outside my windows
crowd below runs wild in the streets
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys
heading for the finish line
Down in the train yard out by the stockyard
butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy
heading for the finish line
Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing
just like these feelings I have for you
And nothing's forever not even five minutes
when you're headed for the finish line
Down in the depot out by the meat rack
down by the tunnels surrounding the jail
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles
they're heading for the finish line
They're lining up for Noah's Ark
they're stabbing each other in the dark
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks
heading for the finish line
Close to the line the ice is cracking
two rented feelings sitting in the stands
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for
all of a sudden it comes back to me
Just up ahead is the finish line
two rented referees and two checkered rags
Out of the corner of my eye comes a dark horse with black wings
headed for the finish line
I'm five years old the room is fuzzy
I think there's also a very young girl
It's hard to remember what happened exactly
as I'm staring at the finish line
First came fire then came light
then came feeling then cane sight
I met a new me at 8 am, the other one got lost
this was not a trade in, although I wouldn't believe the cost
I woke up crying as we said goodbye
me an my old self, each day he vanished more and more
as I became someone else
He actually was murdered I had taken him apart
but when I put him back together, I couldn't find his heart
It was resting underneath a chair, in a bed of bright tin foil
if I pulled back the flaps, I could still see it beat
I could still hear his voice uncoil, As I said:
I want a trade in, a 14th chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
and I want to make her my wife
How could I have been so mistaken, how could I think that it was true
a child that is raised by an idiot, and that idiot then becomes you
How could I believe in a movie, how could I believe in a book
but most of all how could I listen to you, such an obvious schmuck
A life spent listening to assholes, it's funny but it's true
so get rid of them I said to myself
but first I'm getting rid of you
I want a trade in, a 14th chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
and I want to make her my wife
Take me over to the window, my heart said to my head
please set me on fine, so we can start again
I was so wrong that it's funny, and I can't apologize
but instead you can be everything that I'm not, the second that I die
ooohhh, I want a trade in, the second chance at this life
I've met a woman with a thousand faces
and I want to make her my wife
Ha!
A 14th chance at this life, I want a trade in ...
... I said ... uuuhhh, 14th, 14th chance at this life
When your imagination has too much to say
when the chill of the night meets the sweat of the day
And you have trouble understanding what other people have to say
you'd better
Hang on to your emotions, hang on to your emotions
When a demagogue inside your head has taken charge
and by default what you say or do is criticized
And this litany of failures is recited a thousand times
you'd better
Hang on to your emotions, hang on to your emotions
Could it be you've never felt like that
that your mind's a cage - inside the cage a cat
that spits and scratches all it can get at
And that's you, and your emotions
Could it be you've never felt like that
your mind's a cage - inside the cage a rat
rabidly trying to get it, you
And your emotions, you and your emotions
When your imagination has too much to say
when that facile voice inside your head says give your life away
You might think to ask - how it got that way
what books it has read - that make it that way
And where it got the right - to speak to anyone that way
you'd better
Hold on to your emotions, hold on to your emotions
When a night city's breeze blows across the room
and a 5 am moon and sun start their swoon
You hear your lover's breath
and not a moment too soon
you get to
Release all your emotions, you get to
let go of your emotions, and now
Release all your emotions, you'd better
let go of your emotions
Release, I wanna let go
I wanna release, now
I was thinking of things that I hate to do
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Things you do to me or I do to you, baby
SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Something fatter or uglier than Rush Rambo
Something more disgusting than Robert Dole
Something pink that climbs out of a hole
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
I was getting so sick of this right wing republican shit
These ugly old man scared of young tit and dick
So I try to think of something that made me sick
And there it was - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Now these old fucks can steal all they want
And they can go and pass laws saying you can't say what you want
And you can't look at this and you can't look at that
And you can't smoke this and you can't snort that
And me baby - I got statistics - I got stats
These people have been to bed with their parents
Now I know you're shocked but hang and have a brew
If you think about it for a minute you know that it's true
They're ashamed and repelled and they don't know what to do
They've had sex with their parents
When they looked into their lovers eyes they saw - mom
In the name of the family values we must ask whose family
In the name of the family values we must ask - Senator
It's has been reported that you have had
Illegal congress with your mother, - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
ah, Senator
An illegal congress by proxy is a
Pigeon by any other name, - SEX WITH YOUR PARENTS
Senators you polish a turd
Here in the big city we got a word
For those who would bed their beloved big bird
And make a mockery of our freedoms
Ah, without even using a condom
Without even saying "no"
By god we have a name for people like that
It's - hey motherfucker
I'm standing with you on your roof
Looking at the chemical sky
All purple blue and oranges
Some pigeons flying by
The traffic on canal street's so noisy
It's a shock
And someone's shooting fireworks or a gun
On the next block
An-an-and, I wanna hookywooky with you
I wanna hookywooky with you
The traffic's so noisy it's a shock
Sounds like fireworks or a gun on the next block
Ah, hookywooky with you
Your ex-lover satchel is here from france
Yet another ex
They gather about you like a mother superior
All of you still friends, but -
None of my old flames ever talk to me when things
End for me they end
They take your pants, your money, your name
But the song still remains
An-an-and, I wanna hookywooky with you
Ah-ha-ha-ha, I wanna hookywooky with you
Then they take your pants, your money, your name
But the song still remains, sayin' -
I wanna hookywooky with you
You're so civilized it hurts
I guess I could learn a lot, ha-ha...
About people, plants and relationships
How not to get hurt a lot
And each lover I meet up your roof
I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..
Into the chemical sky, down into the streets to die
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
And each lover I meet up on your roof
I wouldn't want to throw him off, mmmmm..
Into the chemical sky
Under the wheels of a car to die on canal street
Ah-ah-hi, I wanna, ah, hookywooky with you
Ah-huh, huh-huh-huh-ah
I wanna hookywooky with you
I wouldn't want to throw him off into the chemical sky
Down into the streets to die
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Hookywooky
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Hookywooky
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Under the wheels of a car on canal street
Hooky-hooky-hooky-wooky
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)
(under the wheels of a car on canal street)
You can't have the flower without the root
you can't have the fire without the soot
Even a stripper needs her red tasseled suit
and we were meant to be
In every war the North needs the south
and everyone knows all assholes have a mouth
Without mystery what would writers talk about
and we were meant to be
An apple needs pits the way melons need seed
your foot needs your arm and your arm needs your knee
And one of these days I know you will need me
we were meant to be, ooohhh, we were meant to be
You're mother's an ogre your father's a scamp
you won't see my parents honored on any stamp
But just like a bulb screws into a lamp
we were meant to be
The way the AIDS needs a vaccine, somewhere a vaccine needs
AIDS, The way a victim needs life, a life needs to be saved
And out of all of this will come a better way
we were meant to be
So you can go to Europe, Los Angeles or Mars
you can stand on a building throwing cinder blocks on cars
You can practice deep voodoo, but like me you'll see
we were meant to be, we were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
We were meant to be
You're an adventurer
you sail across the oceans
you climb the Himalayas
seeking truth and beauty as a natural state
You're a queen reborn
worshipped from above afar
some see you as an elixir
an elemental natural seeking perfect grace
In a catacomb
or cave of endless drawings
prehistoric or religious
your accomplishments prodigious
seeking out the perfect tone
Your language so clear
your voice perfectly turning
as in the city I sit yearning
blowing rings of smoke from thin cigars
or driving fast in foreign cars
to capture your remains, huh
You're an adventurer
a turban wet wrapped 'round your head
on the mountainside they predict your death
oh how you fooled them all
But subjects are a poor excuse
when what you really want's a muse
an inspirating knowledge
of what comes before
Ooohhh, speeds of light
the momentary flicker
of a candle in its wicker basket
smoking wax, facts
Did you find that superior knowledge
that eluded you in college
Did you find that super vortex
that could cause your cerebral cortex
ooohhh, to lose its grip
You're an adventurer
you were out looking for meaning
while the rest of us were steaming
in an inspirating
ah, urban pit
An adventurer
you enter as I'm dreaming
I wish I'd never wake up
Differentiating scheming from my one true love
You're an adventurer
you love the angles and the cherries
the height and width of levies
the natural bridge and tunnels of the human race
You're an adventurer
nothing seem to scare you
and if it does it won't dissuade you
you just will not think about it
you dismiss it and defocus
you redefine the locus of your time in space, race
As you move further from me
and though I understand the thinking
and have often done the same thing
I find parts of me gone
You're an adventurer
and though I'll surely miss you
and of course I'll survive without you
and maybe good will come of that
But at this point, ah
I anticipate some grieving
and although I know your leaving
is a necessary adjunct to what we both do
An adventurer
splitting up the atom
splitting up the once was
splitting up the essence of our star-crossed fate
None who meet you
do forget you, my adventurer
my adventurer, my adventurer-venturer
my adventuress
She's out of her mind
like the wind in the storm
Oh, like the ocean in the dawn
as it disappears, with the riptide
She's out of her mind
she's pulled away by the moon
She's ripped from her sleep
as the cold luna sweep gains control
Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
Ah, ones you barely recognize
In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh
"This is not voluntary! This is not voluntary!
If this is life I'd rather die!"
In the riptide, in the riptide
She's out of her mind, riptide
like a muscle that swells
You know when you trip
whether you're well or sick, your body aches
She's out with the tide
gone to a prisoner's dance
Where a monkey's her date
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon
Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions
said the seagull to the loon
What you gonna do with your emotions
She said "Please wake me up"
She said "Don't touch me now"
She said "I wish I was dead"
With the riptide
She's out of her mind
riptide, you always win
It happens over and over again
riptide
She's out of her mind
like a hurricane's rain
She does not stand a chance
at this luna dance, riptide
I was thinking of Van Gogh's last painting
the wheatfields and the crows
Is that perhaps what you've been feeling
When you see the ground
as you fall from the shy
As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide
She's going out of her mind
out with the tide
out of her mind
riptide
She's going out of her mind
with the riptide
She's going out of her mind
ah, riptide
Take me for what I am
a star newly emerging
Long simmering explodes
inside the self is reeling
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood
in the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love
I accept the new found man
and set the twilight reeling
At 5 am the moon and the sun
sit set before my window
Light glances off the blue glass we set
right before the window
And you who accept, in your soul and your head
what was misunderstood, what was thought of with dread
a new self is born, the other self dead
I accept the new found man
and set the twilight reeling
A soul singer stands on the stage
the spotlight shows him sweating
He sinks to one knee, seems to cry
the horn are unrelenting
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard
in the microphone's face he sees her face growing large
and the swelling crescendo no longer retards
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling
As the twilight sunburst gleams
as the chromium moon it sets
As I lose all my regrets
and set the twilight reeling
I accept the new found man
and set the twilight reeling
How come you say you will and then you won't
you change your mind and then you say you don't
The mystery is why I play the goat
the mystery you call love
Sometimes you're like an eagle strong like a rock
other times it seems you get unlocked
And all your worst fears come tumbling out
into the street, into the snow
I remember when you had a dream
everything was what it seemed to be
But now nightmares replace everything
and everything you see is wrong
You said we'd meet but you're two hours late
you said you thought someone had picked your gate
So you hid and were afraid to wait
seeing shadows in the snow
Seeing shadows in the snow
Now your friend Godfrey is a perfect choice
one minute down next time rejoice, he seems -
- To have found the perfect voice
paranoia key of E
Let's say everything he says is true
you love me but I cheat on you
And in my bedroom is a female zoo
worse then Clinton in prime time
I swear to you I'm not with Jill or Joyce
or Cyd or Sherry or Darlene or worse
I'm not kissing you while inside I curse
paranoia key of E
Let's play a game the next time we meet, ah
I'll be the hands and you be the feet
And together we will keep the beat
to paranoia key of E
Now, you know mania's in the key of B
psychosis in the key of C
Let's hope that we're not meant to be
in paranoia key of E
Anorexia is in G flat
and F is anything I've left out
Dyslexia, kleptomania and vertigo
patricide A, matricide D the same schizos
Paranoia key of E
Let's have a coda in the key of K
something that only we can play
Maybe we'll light up like a hundred K
paranoia out of key
Paranoia key of E
paranoia key of E
Anorexia, dyslexia
kleptomania, patricide A, matricide D, vertigo, schizos
Paranoia key of E, paranoia
paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
Paranoia, paranoia, paranoia key of E
It was only the time of the newly born dead
with wispy cobwebs in your head
the polar moon looked out instead
goin' wild
Liquor shifting through the brain
the manic depressive goes insane
goin' wild
goin' wild
Desperate anger hits the streets
by the foul smelling river by the meat market
goin' wild
mystic child
Goin' wild
mystic child
In the winter with frozen toes
looking out the big windows
to fly
goin' wild
Situation X out of control
my eyes half opened like a mole
who smiles
goin' wild
Who smiles
goin' wild
In the mystic morning where the river meets
the hurdy-gurdy of the hip-hop beat
5 a.m. the viscous street
Oh, wild
goin' wild
Out the window like a flash
fallin' through a rooftop crash
blind
goin' wild
Sick and misty like a pup by the curb
he's throwin' up
wild
like a child
Goin' wild
like a child
If he can't have all that relates
to testify that he is great
he'll cut someone with a broken plate
stand upon the subway grate
And smile
goin' wild
goin' wild
with a smile
Holy morning
sun is up and someone
here has lost his cups
The dawn is tattered all cut up
goin' wild
like a mystic child
Like a mystic child
Sunday morning looking down from the rooftop
goin' wild with a smile
mystic child
Top of the world he's got it made
rings are gold, braids are jade
jumped to the street, he's got it made
goodbye, child
Goodbye, child
mystic child
goin' wild
like a mystic child
Goodbye
goodbye
Goin' wild, ah
goin' wild
Like a mystic child
holy morning
sun is up and someone
Going wild
like a mystic, like a mystic, like a mystic -
- Child
goin'-goin', goin'-goin' wild
Like a mystic child
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh
Jumped to the street
Mad, you just make me mad
I hate your silent breathing in the night
Sad, you make me sad
when I juxtapose your features I get sad
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, I was so tired
who would think you'd find a bobby pin
it just makes me mad, makes me mad
It just makes me, makes me -
- Mad
Glad, when I'm gone you're glad
that overwhelming tension dissipates
Oh, tad, you think I'm a baby
nobody likes to here, Why don't you grow up at dawn
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, so tired
who would think you'd find a bobby pin
it makes me mad, makes me mad
Don't you know it just makes me -
- Mad
it just makes me mad
Dumb, you're dumb as my thumb
in the wistful morning you throw a coffee cup at my head
Scum, you said I'm scum
what a very lovely and feminine thing to do
Bark, why don't you just bark
sit, come, stay are the perfect words meant for you
Ah, ass, you says I'm an ass
you better call 911 just I'm gonna hold you tight
I know I shouldn't had someone else in our bed
but I was so tired, so tired
you said you're out of town for the night
and I believed in you, I believed you
And I was so tired, it makes me so mad
it makes me so -
- Mad
it makes me so mad
It just makes me mad
it makes me mad
It makes me mad
it makes me mad
It makes me mad
It makes me mad, ah
dumb
They call you ecstasy
nothing ever sticks to you
Not velcro, not scotch tape
not my arms dipped in glue
Not if I wrap myself in nylon
a piece of duct tape down my back
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve
and I can't get you back
Ah, ecstasy
ecstasy
Ah, ecstasy
Across the streets an old Ford, they took off its wheels
the engine is gone
In its seat sits a box
with a note that says, Goodbye Charlie, thanks a lot
I see a child through a window with a bib
and I think of us and what we almost did
The Hudson rocketing with light
the ships pass the Statue of Liberty at night
They call it ecstasy, ah
ecstasy
Ecstasy, ah
ecstasy
Some men call me St. Ivory
some call me St. Maurice
I'm smooth as alabaster
with white veins runnin' through my cheeks
A big stud through my eyebrow
a scar on my arm that says, Domain
I put it over the tattoo
that contained your name
They called you ecstasy, ecstasy
ecstasy
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy
ecstasy
The moon passing through a cloud
a body facing up is floating towards a crowd
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you
They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down
I can't hold you up
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio
no engine, no hood
I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music
and I hope that they can play
But if we have to part
I'll have a new scar right over my heart
I'll call it ecstasy
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy
ecstasy
Ecstasy, ecstasy
ecstasy
Maybe I should go and live in Amsterdam
in a side street near a big canal
spend my evenings in the Van Gogh Museum
what a dream, Van Gogh Museum
Maybe its time to see Tangiers
a different life-style, some different fears
and maybe I should be in Edinburgh
in a kilt in Edinburgh
Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance
Or maybe I should get a farm in southern France
where the winds are wispy and the villagers dance
and you and I we'd sleep beneath a moon
moon in June and sleep till noon
And maybe you and I could fall in love
regain the spirit that we once had
you'd let me hold you and touch the night
that shines so bright, so bright with fright
Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance
Shit, maybe I could go to Yucatan
where women are women, a man's a man
ah, no one confused, ever loses place
with their place in the human race
Maybe I'm not cut out for city life
the smell of exhaust, the smell of strife
and maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not a life being a wife
Doin' a modern dance
doin' a modern dance
So maybe I should go to Tanganyika
where the rivers run, down mountains tall and steep
or go to India to study chants
and lose romance to a mantra's dance
I need a guru, I need some law
explain to me the things we saw
why it always comes to this
it's all downhill after the first kiss
Maybe I should move to Rotterdam
maybe move to Amsterdam
I should move to Ireland, Italy, Spain
Afghanistan where there is no rain
Or maybe I should just learn a modern dance
where roles are shifting the modern dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
this week, this month, this time of year
this week, this month, this time of year
Doin' a modern dance
you don't know who you're with modern dance
I should move to Pakistan, go to Afghanistan
Dance, you don't know who you're with
dance, you don't know who you're with
modern dance
And maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not life being a wife
doin' a modern dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
the roles are shifting dance
you never touch you don't know who you're with
Dance, modern dance
maybe you don't wanna be a wife
it's not a life being a wife
Some couples live in harmony
some do not
Some couples yell and scream
some do not
But what you said was something
that I can't forget
It echoes in my head
like a bullet made of lead
Some people yell and scream
and some do not
Some people sacrifice their lives
and some do not
Some people wait for sleep
to take them away
While others read books endlessly
hoping problems will go away
I know you're hoping everything
works out
Neither one of us is
the type who shouts
You sleep in the bedroom
while I pace up and down the hall
Our baby stares at both of us
wondering which one of us to call
I guess it's true that not
every match burns bright
I guess it's true
not all that I say is right
But what you said still bounces
around in my head
Who thought this could happen to us
when we first went to bed
I'm told in the end
that none of this matters
All couples have troubles
and none of this matters
But what you said
still echoes in my head
And I'm still in the hallway
downstairs sleeping alone instead
I know you don't care
but here's my last thought
Not that it matters
but here's the last thing I thought
Our little thing is lying
here in tatters
And you my dear
don't have any manners
Sad to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
Saddening to leave this way
to leave it all in tatters
I suppose that we all could say
that nothing of it matters
Still it's sad
to see everything in tatters
Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight
split like a cord of wood my family broke up
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow
a breathing piece of shit
Picked for my age, for my strength and make up
called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up
A tree or a piece of steel I could do
what my fat owner can't
Ah, future farmers of America
future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
Ah
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale
I'd disappear under a bush
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite
kill your master with one cut of your knife
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk
kill them whenever you can
Future farmers of America
future farmers of America
Future farmers of America
These -
- stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart
look at me, I'll never own land that I work on
Every one of us here shares a surname
this father must die
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight
my father was dark, my mother was light
Look at me, I'm strong
I could crush him in my fist
Ah
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
Future farmers of America
I could crush him in my fist
She says, What do you call love
well I call it Harry
Oh, please I'm being serious
what do you call love
Well I don't call it family and I don't call it lust
and as we all know marriage isn't a must
And I suppose in the end, it's a matter of trust
if I had to I'd call love time
She says, What do you call love
can't you be more specific
What do you call love
is it more than the heart's hieroglyphic
Well for me time has no meaning, no future, no past
and when you're in love, you don't have to ask
There's never enough time to hold love in your grasp
turning time around
Turning time around
that is what love is
Turning time around
yes, that is what love is
My time is your time when you're in love
and time is what you never have enough of
You can't see or hold it, it's exactly like love
Turning time around
turning time around
Turning time around
turning time around
Turning time around
well I gotta have it
I gotta-gotta-gotta have it
Turning, turning time around
gotta have it, turning time around
Turning, turning time around
turning time around
There's a white prism with phony jism
spread across its face
and the soulful convicts forever interred
lose the smile across their faces
The smile that registered hopes or dreams
has proven just a waste
And I'm the indentured servant
forever in his place
I'm the indentured servant
forever in his place
I wish I built a cabinet
of shiny bolts and wood
secret draws and hiding places
sculpted out of wood
Secret places, secret lies
in a desk lying alone
A secret letter written to you
to be read when you're alone
A secret letter written to you
to be read when you're alone
It says, I'm your indentured servant
I can no longer pretend
that I'm a lover or an equal
I'm not even a friend
I'm not good enough to serve you
I'm not good enough to stay
So it is that I beseech you
to please turn me away
so it is that I beseech you
to please turn me away
Turn me away
turn me away
turn me away
I'm asking you to let me go
it hurts me when you're sad
and I can not do better than this
which must surely make you mad
I'd be better off in your cabinet
or in a prison made of cloth
Crouched beneath your dress I come
shooting little spurts
crouched beneath your dress I come
shooting little spurts
I'm your indentured servant
but even I have pride
in what I make or say or do
although I've lots to hide
I hide from freedom and I hide from you
'cause you've found me out
I belong in prison beneath your legs
in a cabinet that I've built
beneath a candle in a secret drawer
in a prison by a moat
I'm your indentured servant
and I'm asking you to leave
me outside this prison cell
where only you can breathe
I-I-I, I'm your indentured servant
but I'm asking you for this
Please release me from this love
and do it with a kiss
I'm your indentured servant
I'm the one you'll miss
Do it with a kiss
do it with a kiss
do it with a kiss
I'm the one you'll miss
Paralyzed by hatred and a piss ugly soul
if he murdered his father, he thought he'd become whole
While listening at night to an old radio
where they danced to the rock minuet
In the gay bars in the back of the bar
he consummated hatred on a cold sawdust floor
While the jukebox played backbeats, he sniffed coke off a jar
while they danced to a rock minuet
School was a waste, he was meant for the street
but school was the only way, the army could be beat
The two whores sucked his nipples 'til he came on their feet
as they danced to the rock minuet
He dreamt that his father was sunk to his knees
his leather belt tied so tight that it was hard to breathe
And the studs from his jacket were as cold as a breeze
as he danced to a rock minuet
He pictured the bedroom where he heard the first cry
his mother on all fours, ah, with his father behind
And her yell hurt so much, he had wished he'd gone blind
and rocked to a rock minuet
In the back of the warehouse were a couple of guys
they had tied someone up and sewn up their eyes
And he got so excited he came on his thighs
when they danced to the rock minuet
On Avenue B, someone cruised him one night
he took him in an alley and then pulled a knife
And thought of his father, as he cut his windpipe
and finally danced to the rock minuet
In the curse of the alley, the thrill of the street
on the bitter cold docks where the outlaws all meet
In euphoria drug in euphoria heat
you could dance to the rock minuet
In the thrill of the needle and anonymous sex
you could dance to the rock minuet
So when you dance hard, slow dancing
when you dance hard, slow dancing
When you dance hard, slow dancing
when you dance to the rock minuet
When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a Mariachi band
I think of sixteen and a crisp green football field
I think of a girl I never had
When I think of you Baton Rouge
I think of a back seat in a car
Windows are foggy and so are we
as the police asked for our I.D.
So helpless
so helpless
Ooohhh, ooohhh, so helpless
ooohhh, so helpless
Ooohhh, so helpless
so helpless
Well I once had a car lost it in a divorce
the judge was a woman of course
She said give her the car and the house and your taste
or else I set the trial date
So now when I think of you Baton Rouge
and the deep southern belles with their touch
I wonder where love ends and hate starts to blush
in the fields in the swamps in the rush
In the terra-cotta cobwebs of your mind
when did you start seeing me as a spider spinning web
Of malicious intent and you as poor, poor me
at the fire at the joint, this disinterred and broken mount
in the bedroom in the house where we were unmarried
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
When was I the villain in your heart
putting the brake on your start
you slapped my face and cried and screamed
that's what marriage came to mean
The bitterest ending of a dream
You wanted children and I did not
was that what it was all about
You might get a laugh when you hear me shout
you might get a laugh when you hear me shout
I wish I had
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
Sometimes when I think of Baton Rouge
I see us with two and a half strapping sons
One and a half flushed daughters preparing to marry
and two fat grandsons I can barely carry
Daddy, uncle, family gathered there for grace
a dog in a barbecue pit goes up in space
The dream recedes in the morning with a bad aftertaste
and I'm back in the big city worn from the race of the chase
what a waste
So thanks for the card the announcement of child
and I must say you and Sam look great
Your daughter's gleaming in that -
- white wedding dress with pride
sad to say I could never bring that to you that wide smile
So I try not to think of Baton Rouge
or of a, of a, of a Mariachi band
Or of sixteen and a crisp green football field
and the girl, and the girl I never had
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
So helpless, so helpless
so helpless
Good morning, it's possum day
feel like a possum in every way
like a possum
Possum whiskers, possum face
possum breath and a possum taste
ooohhh, like a possum
Possum tales, possum eyes
possum bones, possum thighs
oh, like a possum
Possum shots, possum runs
possum sleeps to possum drums
calm as an angel
Good morning, it's possum day
I feel like a possum in every way
like a possum
Wake up with a possum smile
look at me, look at this smile
like a possum
Things are all right, don't worry about this
my mind's amiss, I've lost the kiss
My smile is leaden, my gait is rubber
and I say as one possum to another like a possum
calm as an angel
The only thing I hope to never see
is another possum in this tree
playing possum
Just like a possum
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
Slurping and squeezing ain't it just my luck
got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
the size of a truck
The devil tried to fill me up but my down was high
as the sky is up, ah
ain't that just my luck
calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming 'til it hurts
calm, calm, ah, calm
calm as an angel
They're mating like apes in the zoo
ah, one for me and one for you
wouldn't it just be lovely
Another useless night in bed, ah, ah
by the Hudson River, the roller-bladers giving head
used condoms float on the river edge's head
Wouldn't it be lovely
wouldn't it be lovely
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by one-night fuck
like a possum
like a possum
Ahhh
calm as an angel
You know me I like to dance a lot
with different selves who cancel out
one another
I'm the only one left standing
One likes muscles, oil and dirt
and the other likes the women with the butt that hurts
like a possum
Devil tried to fill me up
but my down was high as the sky is up
calm as an angel
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
and it won't be filled by a one-night fuck
like a possum
You know me I like to drink a lot
and carry on
don't know which self will show up, ah
over the 5 a.m. sun, -
- The moon is shining
over the docks shining
ooohhh, calm as an angel
Girls in the market know what I'm about
they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts, ah
with a pierced tongue licking below a stained T-shirt
Look at this smile
My mind's amiss
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming 'til it hurts
calm, calm
Sitting on a curb I throw a rock
at the passing meat market trucks
it's just my luck
I'm the only one left standing
Now you know me I like to drink a lot, ah
only one left standing
The girls in the market know what I'm about
they pinch their nipples and they lift their skirts
licking below a stained T-shirt
calm as an angel
Smoking crack with a downtown flirt
shooting and coming baby 'til it hurts
wouldn't it be, wouldn't it be
Wouldn't it be love
wouldn't it be lovely
calm as an angel
Got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
it won't be filled by one-night fuck
Ain't it just my luck
I got a hole in my heart the size of a truck
Another useless night in bed
walk down the Hudson River getting head
calm, calm, calm, calm, calm as an angel
Don't know why baby, I'm still here strong
and fearless in the outside air
I'm the only one left standing
I'm the only one
the only one
the only one left standing
I'm the only one
I'm the only one
left standing
calm as an angel
I'm the only one
I'm the only one, the only one
left standing
calm as an angel
Shooting an coming 'til it hurts
o'holy morning
Calm as an angel
Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
big sky, big sky holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
but it can't hold us down anymore
Big sky holding up the stars
big sky holding Venus and Mars
Big sky catch you in a jar
but it can't hold us down anymore
Big sky, big enormous place
big wind blow all over the place
Big storm wrecking havoc and waste
but it can't hold us down anymore
Ooohhh, big goals, big ambitious goals
big talk, talking till I fold
Big wind talking through torrential love
but it can't hold us down anymore
Big sin, big sin, big original sin
paradise where I've never been
Big snake break the skin
but you can't hold us down anymore
A big house holds a family
a big room it holds you and me
It's a big mess and baby makes three
and you can't hold us down anymore
Big news, they're out of their heads
big-big-big news, let's fuck them instead
There's a big joke did they think we were monks
but they can't hold us down anymore
A big doll, big enormous eyes
big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size
they can't hold us down anymore
Big sky, big sky holding up the sun
big sky holding, holding up the moon
Big sky holding down the sea
but it can't hold us down anymore
Oh, big doll, big enormous eyes
big love holds you in a vise
A big man who cut them down to size, ah
they can't hold us down anymore
Oh-oh, big sky
big sky
Big sky
ah, they can't hold us down anymore
Lo! 't is a gala night
A mystic throng bedecked
Sit in a theater to see
A play of hopes and fears
While the orchestra breathes fitfully
The music of the spheres
Mimes, mutter and mumble low
Mere puppets they, who come and go
Disguised as gods
They shift the scenery to and fro
Inevitably trapped by invisible Wo
This motley drama
to be sure
Will not be forgotten
A phantom chased for evermore
Never seized by the crowd
Through they circle
Returning to the same spot
Circle and return to the selfsame spot
Always to the selfsame spot
With much of madness and more of sin
And horror and mimic rout
The soul of the plot
Out
out are the lights
out all
And over each dying form
The curtain a funeral pall
Comes with the rush of a storm
The angels haggard and wan
Unveiling and uprising affirm
That the play is the tragedy "Man"
And its hero the Conqueror Worm
As I look back on my life
If I could have the glorious moment
The wondrous opportunity to comprehend
The chance to see my younger self
One time
To converse
To hear his thoughts
These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
He'll tell you tales of horror
Then he'll play with your mind
If you haven't heard of him
You must be deaf or blind
These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
He'll tell you about Usher
Whose house burned in his mind
His love for his dear sister
Her death would drive him wild
The murder of a stranger
The murder of a friend
The callings from the pits of hell
That never seem to end
These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
These are the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
The diabolic image of the city and the sea
The chaos and the carnage that reside deep within me
Decapitations, poisonings, hellish not a bore
You won't need 3D glasses to pass beyond this door
Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
No Nosferatu Vincent Price or naked women here
A mind unfurled, a mind unbent is all we have here
Truth, fried orangutans flutter to the stage
Leave your expectations home
And listen to the stories of Edgar Allan Poe
We give you the soliloquy the raven at the door
Flaming pits the moving walls no equilibrium
No ballast, no bombast
The unvarnished truth we've got
Mind swoons guilty
Cooking ravings in a pot
Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
Edgar Allan Poe
Not exactly the boy next door
Tell-tale heart a rotting cask
A valley of unrest
A conqueror worm devouring souls
Keep the best for last
Rings for Annie Lee
As Poe's buried alive
Regretting his beloved's death in
All her many guises-a
Far away far away
Are not all lovely things far away
As far at least lies that valley
as the bedridden sun in the luminous east
The paralyzed mountains, the sickly river
Are not all things lovely far away
Are not all things lovely far away
It is a valley where time is not interrupted
Where its history shall not be interpreted
Stories of satan's dart of angel wings
Unhappy things
Within the valley of unrest
The sun ray dripped all red
The dell was silent
All the people having gone to war
Leaving no interrogator to mind
the willful looting the pale past knowledge
The sly mysterious stars
The unguarded flowers leaning
The tulips overhead paler
The terror stricken sky
Rolling like a waterfall
over the horizon's fiery wall
A visage full of meaning
How the unhappy shall confess
As Roderick watches like a human eye
While violets and lilies wave
Like banners in the sky
Hovering over and above a grave
As dew drops on the freshly planted eternal dew
Coming down in gems
There's no use to pretend
Though gorgeous clouds fly
Roderick, like the human eye has closed forever
Far away far away
Roderick, whatever thy image may be
Roderick, no magic shall sever the music from thee
Thou hast bound many eyes in a dreamy sleep
Oh tortured day
The strains still arrive
I hear the bells
I have kept my vigilance
Rain dancing in the rhythm of a shower
Over what guilty spirit to not hear the beating
To not hear the beating heart
But only tears of perfect moan
Only tears of perfect moan
Caught in the crossbow of ideas and journeys
sit here reliving the other self's mournings
Caught in the crossbow of ideas and dawnings
stand I
Oh oh oh oh
Reliving the past of the maddening impulse
violent upheaval, the pure driven instinct
The pure driven murder, the attraction of daring
stand I
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call on me
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call
A wild being from birth
my spirit spurns control
wondering the wide earth
searching for my soul
Dimly peering
I would surely find
what could there be more purely bright
in truth's day-star
Ooohhh
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call, call on me
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call on me
Why didn't you call on me
why didn't you call.
Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city
Alone
Death has reared himself a throne
In a strange city
Alone
Their shrines and palaces are not like ours
They do not tremble and rot
Eaten with time
Death has reared himself a throne
Lifted by forgotten winds
Resignedly beneath the sky
The melancholy waters lie
A crown of stars
In a strange city
Alone
A heaven God does not condemn
But the everlasting shadow
Makes mockery of it all
No holy rays come down
Lights from the lurid deep sea
Stream up the turrets silently
Up thrones, up arbors
Of sculpted ivy and stone flowers
Up domes, up spires
Kingly halls all are melancholy shrines
The columns, frieze and entablature
Chokingly shockingly intertwined
The mast the viol and the vine
Twisted
There amid no earthly moans
Hell rises from a thousand thrones
Does reverence to death
And death does give his undivided time
There are open temples
And graves on a level with the waves
Death looms and looks
Huge
Gigantic
There is a ripple
Now a wave
Towers thrown aside
Sinking in the dull tide
The waves glowing redder
The very hours losing their breath
All the cunning stars
Watching fitfully over night after night of
Matchless ........ sleep
Matched only with the whole of dream .......
The tell-tale beating of the heart
The ......... breath
The desire, the pose
One poses upon the precipice
To fall to run to dive to tumble to fall down
Down into the spiral down and then
One sees one's own death
One sees one committing murder or atrocious violent acts
And then across the shadow
Not of man or God
But the shadow resting upon the brazen doorway
There were seven of us there
Who saw the shadow as it came out from among the draperies
But we did not dare behold it
We looked down into the depths of the mirror of ebony
And the apparition spoke
"I am a shadow
And I dwell in the catacombs
Which border
The country of illusion
Hard by the dim plains of wishing"
And then did we start shuddering
Starting from our seats
Trembling
For the tones in the voice of the shadow
Were not the tones of any one man
But of a multitude of beings
And varying in their cadences
From syllable to syllable
Fell duskily upon our ears in the well
Remembered and familiar accents
Of a thousand departed friends
The only thing constantly changing is change
And change is always for the worse
The worm on the hook always eaten by a fish
The fish by bird man or worse
A spot on the lung, a spot on your heart
An aneurism of the soul
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it comes equipped with a curse
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse
The only thing constantly changing is change
The living only become dead
Your hair falling out, your liver swelled up
Your teeth rot your gums and your chin
Your ass starts to sag, your balls shrivel up
Your cock swallowed up in their sack
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always change on your back
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse, baby
The only thing constantly changing is change
Ashes to ashes to dusk
The deer and the rabbit, the musk of your hole
Filled up with myriad dread, ooohhh
The dread of the living, the dread of the living
The frightening pulse of the night, ah
The only thing constantly changing is change
It's changes that will kill us with fright
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it's always for the worse
The only thing constantly changing is change
The only thing constantly changing is change
The only thing constantly changing is change
And it comes equipped with my curse
And then I had a vision
Ah Edgar
Ah Edgar, my dear friend Edgar
It's been a long time, Roderick
I've ridden many miles
It's been a dull and soundless day for autumn
The leaves have lost their autumn glow
and the clouds seem oppressive with their drifting finery
I know, my friend
Though I own so much of this land I find
the country insufferable
I deal only in half pleasures
Speaking of half pleasures
would you care for a tincture of opium?
Nothing would please me more than to smoke
with an old friend
I've experienced the hideous dropping of the veil
the bitter lapse into common life
unredeemed dreariness of thought
I have an iciness, a sickening of the heart
It's true you don't look well, Roderick
but I am your friend
no matter the occasion or position of the stars
I'm glad you wrote me
but I must admit to concern
I cannot contain my heart
Edgar, I look to you for solace
for relief from myself
What I have is constitutional
a family evil, a nervous affection that must surely pass
But I do have this morbid acuteness of senses
I can eat only the most insipid food
clothes only of the lightest texture
The odor of flowers I find oppressive
My eyes cannot bear even the faintest light
Did you hear that?
I hear
I am listening, go on
I shall perish
I will perish in this deplorable folly
I dread the future
Not the events, the results
The most trivial event
causes the greatest agitation of the soul
I do not fear danger except in its absolute effect terror
I find I must inevitably abandon life and reason together
in my struggles with the demon fear
Perhaps you'll think me superstitious
but the physique of this place
it hovers about me like a great body
some diseased outer shell
some decaying finite skin encasing my morale
You mentioned your sister was ill
My beloved sister, my sole companion
has had a long continuing illness
whose inevitable conclusion seems forsworn
This will leave me the last of the ancient race of Ushers
She looks so much like you
I love her in a nameless way
more than I love myself
Her demise will leave me hopelessly
confined to memories and realities of a future
so barren as to be stultifying
Oh, what of physicians?
Ah, they are baffled
Until today she refused bed rest
wanting to be present in your honor
but finally she succumbed to the prostrating power of the destroyer
You will probably see her no more
Sound and music take us to the twin curves of experience
Like brother and sister intertwined
they relieve themselves of bodily contact
and dance in a pagan revelry
I have soiled myself with my designs
I am ashamed of my brain
The enemy is me
and the executioner terror
Music is a reflection of our inner self
unfiltered agony touches the wayward string
The wayward brain confuses itself
with the self-perceived future
and turns inward with loathing and terror
Either by design or thought
we are doomed to know our own end
I've written a lyric
May I hear it?
It is called "The Haunted Palace"
In the greenest of our valleys,
By good angels tenanted,
Once a fair and stately palace --
Snow-white palace -- reared its head.
Banners yellow, glorious, golden,
On its roof did float and flow;
(This -- all this -- was in the olden time long ago)
And every gentle air that dallied,
Along the rampart plumed and pallid,
A winged odor went away.
All wanderers in that happy valley
Through two luminous windows saw
Spirits moving musically
The sovereign of the realm serene,
A troop of echoes whose sweet duty
Was but to sing
In voices of surpassing beauty,
The wit and wisdom of their king.
But evil things in robes of sorrow,
Assailed the monarch's high estate!
And round about his home the glory,
Is but a dim-remembered story.
Vast forms that move fantastically
To a discordant melody;
While, like a ghastly river,
A hideous throng rush out forever,
And laugh -- but smile no more.
Nevermore.
It's cold in here
I tell you minerals are sentient things
The gradual yet certain condensation of an atmosphere
of their own about the waters and the walls proves this
Thus the silent yet importunate and terrible influence
which for centuries has molded my family
And now me
Excuse me
She is gone
Out, sad light
Roderick has no life
I shall preserve her corpse for a fortnight
But Roderick..
I shall place it in a vault facing the lake
I do not wish to answer to the medical men
nor place her in the exposed burial plot of my family
We shall inter her at the proper date
when I am more fully of a right mind
Her malady was unusual
Please do not question me on this
I cannot question you
Then help me now
One would think you twins
We are
We have always been sympathetic to each other
Have you seen this?
It is her
It is a whirlwind
You should not
You must not behold this
Roderick, these appearances which bewilder you are mere electrical phenomena not uncommon
Or perhaps they have their rank origins in the marshy gases of the lake
Please, let's close this casement and I will read and you will listen
Aand together we will pass this terrible night together
What's that?
What is that?
Don't you hear that?
Not hear it?
Yes, I hear it and have heard it many minutes have I heard it?
Oh, pity me miserable wretch
I dared not
Oh no
I dared not speak
We have put her living in the tomb
I have heard feeble movements in the coffin
I thought I heard
I dared not speak
Oh God
I have heard footsteps
Do you not hear them?
Attention
Do I not distinguish that heavy and horrible beating of her heart?
Madman
Madman
I tell you she now stands without the door
This is the place where she lay her head
when she went to bed at night
And this is the place our children were conceived
candles lit the room brightly at night
And this is the place where she cut her wrists
that odd and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
This is the place where we used to live
I paid for it with love and blood
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf
Filled with her poetry and stuff
And this is the room where she took the razor
and cut her wrists that strange and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
I never would have started if I'd known
that it'd end this way
But funny thing, I'm not at all sad
that it stopped this way
This is the place where she lay her head
when she went to bed at night
And this is the place our children were conceived
candles lit the room brightly at night
And this is the place where she cut her wrists
That odd and fateful night
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling
Just a perfect day
Drink sangria in the park
And then later, when it gets dark
We go home
Just a perfect day
Feed animals in the zoo
Then later a movie, too
And then home
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
Just a perfect day
Problems all left alone
Weekenders on our own
It's such fun
Just a perfect day
You made me forget myself
I thought I was someone else
Someone good
Oh, it's such a perfect day
I'm glad I spent it with you
Oh, such a perfect day
You just keep me hanging on
You just keep me hanging on
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
You're going to reap just what you sow
Once upon a midnight dreary
As I pondered, weak and weary
Over many a quaint and curious
Volume of forgotten lore
While I nodded, nearly napping
Suddenly there came a tapping
As of some one gently rapping
Rapping at my chamber door
"'Tis some visitor," I muttered
"tapping at my chamber door
Only this and nothing more."
Muttering I got up weakly
Always I've had trouble sleeping
Stumbling upright my mind racing
Furtive thoughts flowing once more
I, there hoping for some sunrise
Happiness would be a surprise
Loneliness no longer a prize
Rapping at my chamber door
Seeking out the clever bore
Lost in dreams forever more
Only this and nothing more
Hovering my pulse was racing
Stale tobacco my lips tasting
Scotch sitting upon my basin
Remnants of the night before
Came again
Infernal tapping on the door
In my mind jabbing
Is it in or outside rapping
Calling out to me once more
The fit and fury of Lenore
Nameless here forever more
And the silken sad uncertain
Rustling of the purple curtain
Thrilled me, filled me
With fantastic terrors never felt before
So that now, oh wind, stood breathing
Hoping yet to calm my breathing
"'Tis some visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
Some lost visitor entreating
Entrance at my chamber door
This it is, and nothing more."
Deep into the darkness peering
Long I stood there
Wondering fearing
Doubting dreaming fantasies
No mortal dared to dream before
But the silence was unbroken
And the stillness gave no token
And the only word there spoken
Was the whispered name, "Lenore."
This I thought
And out loud whispered from my lips
The foul name festered
Echoing itself
Merely this, and nothing more
Back into my chamber turning
Every nerve within me burning
When once again I heard a tapping
Somewhat louder than before
"surely," said I
Surely that is something at my iron staircase
Open the door to see what threat is
Open the window, free the shutters
Let us this mystery explore
Oh, bursting heart be still this once
And let this mystery explore
It is the wind and nothing more
Just one epithet I muttered as inside
I gagged and shuddered
When with manly flirt and flutter
In there flew a stately raven
Sleek and ravenous as any foe
Not the least obeisance made he
Not a minutes gesture towards me
Of recognition or politeness
But perched above my chamber door
This fowl and salivating visage
Insinuating with its knowledge
Perched above my chamber door
Silent sat and staring
Nothing more
Askance, askew
The self's sad fancy smiles at you I swear
At this savage viscous countenance it wears
Though you show here shorn and shaven
And I admit myself forlorn and craven
Ghastly grim and ancient raven
Wandering from the opiate shores
Tell me what thy lordly name is
That you are not nightmare sewage
Some dire powder drink or inhalation
Framed from flames of downtown lore
Quotes the raven, "nevermore."
And the raven sitting lonely
Staring sickly at my male sex only
That one word
As if his soul in that one word
He did outpour, "pathetic."
Nothing farther than he uttered
Not a feather then he fluttered
Till finally was I that muttered as I stared
Dully at the floor
"other friends have flown and left me
Flown as each and every hope has flown before
As you no doubt will fore the morrow."
But the bird said, "never, more."
Then I felt the air grow denser
Perfumed from some unseen incense
As though accepting angelic intrusion
When in fact I felt collusion
Before the guise of false memories respite
Respite through the haze of cocaine's glory
I smoke and smoke the blue vial's glory
To forget
At once
The base Lenore
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."
"Prophet," said I, "thing of evil
Prophet still, if bird or devil
By that heaven that bend above us
By that God we both ignore
Tell this soul with sorrow laden
Willful and destructive intent
How had lapsed a pure heart lady
To the greediest of needs
Sweaty arrogant dickless liar
Who ascribed to nothing higher
Than a jab from prick to needle
Straight to betrayal and disgrace
The conscience showing not a trace."
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."
"Be that word our sign of parting
Bird or fiend," I yelled upstarting
"get thee back into the tempest
Into the smoke filled bottle's shore
Leave no black plume as a token
Of the slime thy soul hath spoken
Leave my loneliness unbroken
Quit as those have quit before
Take the talon from my heart
And see that I can care no more
Whatever mattered came before
I vanish with the dead Lenore."
Quoth the raven, "nevermore."
But the raven, never flitting
Still is sitting silent sitting
Above a painting silent painting
Of the forever silenced whore
And his eyes have all the seeming
Of a demon's that is dreaming
And the lamplight over him
Streaming throws his shadow to the floor
I love she who hates me more
I love she who hates me more
And my soul shall not be lifted from that shadow
Nevermore
I'm a little balloon and I get puffed up
squeeze me and bend me it's never enough
Put your lips around me, blow me up
but if you prick me I will pop
I'm a little balloon full and firm
here is my aft and here is my stern
Here's my lips and here's my hose
put me down or I will burst
If you prick me I will burst
Like to thank all you people for showing up tonight
Sorry about the weather
Let's have a big hand for my long time accompianist
Manfred Gooseberry
Hey Goose
Take a bow, relax
Be comfortable
Have a cocktail on the Poo Poo Lounge
And let us entertain you
I'd like to sing you a Broadway song
I hope that you'll all sing along
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your mind at ease
I'd like to play you something low and sexy
look at our dancers they're so young and pretty, hi Olga
And when we start to groove you can hear the saxophones blow
Ah, show business is just a wonderful thing
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing for you
And let the saxophones blow
blow baby blow
I'd like to sing you a Broadway song
I hope that you'll all sing along
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your mind at ease
I wanna bring a tear to your eye, oh
good old Poe don't he make you cry
Ain't it great the way he writes about the mysteries of life
Ah, show business is just a wonderful thing
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing for you
And let the saxophones blow
Blow baby blow
Ah, show business is just a wonderful thing
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing for you
And let the saxophones blow
blow baby blow baby blow baby blow
Go Goose go
True
Nervous
very nervous
Madman
Why will you say that I am mad
The disease has sharpened my senses
not destroyed
not dulled them
Madman
The eye of a vulture
a pale blue eye
with a film overit
Listen
observe how healthily
and how calmly I tell this story
He had no passion for the old man
He was never insulted
He loved him
It was the eye the eye the eye
I made up my mind
To take his life forever
Passionless
The eye of a vulture
You should have seen me
How wisely I proceeded
To rid himself of the eye forever
With what dissimulation I went to work
Caution
I turned the latch on his door
and opened it
To work
To practice
I opened his door
and put in a dark lantern
Dark
Slowly I put my head in
Slowly I thrust it until in time Ientered
I was in so far
He was in so far
he could see the old man sleep
And then I undid the lantern so a thin ray
fell upon the eye
The vulture eye
He did this for seven days
Seven days
But always the eye was closed
and so I could not do the work
And in the day he would greet the old man
calmly in his chamber
Calmly
Nothing is wrong and all is well
Knock, knock
who's there
Came night eight
Night eight
I was slower than a watch minute hand
The power that I had with the old man
not to even dream my secret thoughts
Secret thoughts
My sagacity
I could barely conceal my feelings of triumph
When suddenly the body moved
The body moved
But I went in even further
pushing the door open even further
Who's there
Who's there
I did not move a muscle
I kept quiet and still
The old man sat up in bed
In his bed
Who's there
I heard a groan
and knew it was a groan of mortal terror
not pain or grief
Oh no
It was the low stifled sound that arises
from the bottom of the soul
when overcharged with awe
I felt such awe welling up in my own bosom
deepening with its echo the terrors that distracted me
Knowing what the old man felt and
Pitying him
Although it made me laugh
Ha ha
He'd been lying awake since the first slight noise
He'd been lying awake thinking
Thinking
It is nothing but the wind
The wind
It is nothing but the house settling
The old man stalked with his black shadow
Death approaching
The mournful presence of the unperceived
causing him to feel my presence
Open the lantern
I saw the ray fall on the eye
On the eye
Who's that peeping through my door
Sneaking up and down the hall
I can't stand it anymore
I can't stand it anymore
Who's that peeping through my door
Sneaking up and down the hall
I can't stand it anymore
I can't stand it anymore
Blind rage
I'm in a blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Who's that creeping in my room
Blocking out the stars and moon
I fear you will attack me soon
Who goes there
Who's that creeping in my room
Blocking out the stars and moon
I fear you will attack me soon
Who goes there
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
I'm in a blind rage
Blind rage
You're making me scared
Blind rage
Make me scared
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Blind rage
Furious
It made me furious
A dull quick sound pounding
Like a watch encased in cotton
Tick tock
I knew that sound well
It increased my fury
The beating of the old man's heart
I scarcely breathed and refrained
Motionless
The tattoo of the heart
Hellish
Increased and was extreme
It grew louder
Louder
I am nervous at this dead hour of the night
amid the dreadful silence of this old house
this sound excites me to uncontrollable wrath
I thought someone would hear this sound
I thought his heart would burst
His hour had come
Please open the door
Open the door
The old man has gone to the country
Gone to the country
But please search well
Please search well
These are his treasures
Treasures
Secure and undisturbed
Please sit and rest
You must be fatigued
Wild audacity
Perfect triumph
So they chat
Chat
Of familiar things
I hear ringing
Ringing
Do you not hear it
No
It is louder
It is making my head ache
Do you not hear it
No
No
No
I, I have a headache
The day is long
Do you not hear it
No
Do you fucking mock me
Do you mock me
They know
Do you think me
They know
An imbecile
Do you think me a fool
Villains dissemble no more
I admit the deed
Admit, Admit
Here, here
Admit
It is the beating
of his most hideous heart
Fly through the glass of a window pane
Fall through the sky feeling the rain
Walk on broken glass your tell-tale heart
Look through the bars of a dirty jail cell
Soar to heaven dive to hell
Listen to your tell-tale heart
Setting fires in the ghost twilight
We see you dress we bolt with fright
You see an apparition disappear
Jump to the table, jump up the stairs
Stand on the rooftop, looking out through the air
Walk on broken glass your tell-tale heart
Lenore, am I dreaming
How can death keep us apart, mmmm..
Lenore, I see you burning
And I'd walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Heart
Heart
Heart
Heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Your tell-tale heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers
Walk on burning embers your tell-tale heart
Death by a visitation from God
Death by a visitation from God
I am shadow
Things material and spiritual
Maternal
can be heavy
Suffocating
There are seven iron lamps
which illumine our senses
Seven knives
Seven iron lamps to illumine our senses
and seven bells to celebrate the resurrection
Two marble balls in a sack
one long and slender candle
one mouth
two reckonings
Consternation and treachery
Are you listening
Are you listening to me
Are you paying attention to me
I am shadow
Seven iron lamps
seven oboes
two small balls
and one tiny candle
Tiny candle
One pathetic flame
embers dying
Dying
Five creatures from the monolith
seven whispers from the catacombs
five and seven numbing mumbling speeches
Are you listening
I am drawn to do what I should not
Guilty, guilty, guilty guilty
no, no, never never no
seven mornings
thirteen moons
five wolves
one silk spread morning
seven bells for seven senses
each one lusting lusting
Guiltily
Two milk fed glands ripe and red tipped
Are you listening my little mouse
Each sense ripped from its bodice
each gland primed to its overflow
Do you hear me my little mouse man
Do you hear me little cock
Semen
Are you listening
My little tumescence smear
Ligeia
I stand on the edge and am drawn to it
Guilt
I am shadow
It must be nice to disappear
To have a vanishing act
To always be looking forward
And never looking back
How nice it is to disappear
Float into a mist
With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss
It might be nice to disappear
To have a vanishing act
To always be looking forward
Never look over your back
It must be nice to disappear
Float into a mist
With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss
It must be nice to disappear
To have a vanishing act
To always be moving forward
And never looking back
How nice it is to disappear
Float into a mist
With a young lady on your arm
Looking for a kiss
Looking for a kiss
Float into a mist
Never bet the devil your head
When I was an infant
my mother treated me like a tough steak
To her well regulated mind
babies were the better for beatings
But she was left handed
and a child flogged left handed
is better left unflogged
The world revolves from right to left
It will not do to whip a baby from left to right
If each blow in the right direction
drives an evil propensity out
a blow in the opposite direction
knocks it's quota of wickedness in
Hence my precocity in vice
my sensitivity to injuries
the thousands of injuries heaped upon me by Fortunato
and then finally his rabid insults for which I vowed revenge
I gave no utterance to threat
But the knowledge of "avengemenship"
was so definite so precise
that no risk could befall me
by neither word
nor deed had I given cause to doubt my good will
I would punish with impunity
I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face
I will redress the wrong
But lips and psyche
mind be silent
Fortunato approaches
Don't take me to task
for loving a cask
The cask of Amontillado
Please don't make a pass
You can go kiss my ass
All I want is this mythical cask
The cask of Amontillado
I've heard so much through the grapevine
I've heard so much on the line
But the one thing that I lust after
Is the one thing I've never had
So is it too much to ask
Too have just one taste of the cask
Why you could go kiss my ass for the cask
of Amontillado
Edgar old fellow
dear bosom friend
Hail fellow well met
oh great elucidator
great epopee
Haha..
Fortunato what luck to meet you
what good good luck to meet
you and see you looking so splendid
I have received a cask of Amontillado
or what passes
for Amontillado
Amontillado
That most wondrous sherry
A cask
Impossible
How
So rare
I've had my doubts
I was silly enough to pay the full price
without consulting you in the matter
but you were not to be found
and I was fearful of losing a bargain
Fearfully stupid if you ask me Edgar
I am on my way to see Mr. Bolo
A cask
A cask
To gather his opinion
Are you engaged
Mr. Bolo cannot tell Amontillado from goat's milk
Yet some say his taste is a match for your own
Hardly, dear boy
Let us go
Where
To your vaults to the supposed Amontillado
Oh my good friend no
I could not impose upon your good nature
You have, after all, an engagement
To hell with the engagement
I have no engagement
Before the sky withers and falls let us go
But the vaults are damp
and I see you are afflicted with a severe cold
Oh let us go
The cold is nothing
You've been taken advantage of
And Mr. Bolo cannot tell Amontillado from piss
The cask
It is farther on
But see the white web work
which gleams from these cavern walls
Nitre
Nitre
How long have you had that cough
Yes, nitre
It is nothing
We should go back
Your health is precious
You are a man who would be missed
Let's return
I cannot be responsible for causing you ill health
And anyway there's always Mr. Bolo
Oh be dumb I'll not be swayed
The cough is nothing
It will not kill me
I won't die of a cough
Of that you can be sure
Have some of this Medoc to warm the bones
and defend you from this infernal dampness
Drink
Drink damn you
I drink to the buried that repose around us
And I to your long life
The nitre
It hangs like moss
We are below the river's bed
The moisture trickles, chills the bones
Let's go back
Your cough
The cough is nothing
But .............
Let us proceed to the Amontillado
So proceed
Herein the Amontillado
Now Mr. Bolo
Mr. Bolo is an imbecile
An ignoramus
Can you not feel the nitre
You really should go
I implore you
No
Then I must leave you here
But first
let me render you all the little attentions within my power
The Amontillado
Hahahaha..
A very good joke indeed, haha..
We will have many a rich laugh about it
over our wine in the palazzo
The Amontillado
Yes, yes yes
The Amontillado
Well
Then let's go
For, for the love of God
Precisely
for the love of God
Fortunato

Guilty
Guilty
I'm paralyzed with guilt
It runs through me like rain through silk
Guilty
My mind won't leave me alone
My teeth are rotted
My lips start to foam
Cause I'm so guilty
Guilty
Guilty
Oh guilty
What did I say

A wild being from birth
My spirit spurns control
Wondering the wide earth searching for my soul
While all the world is chiding
In visions of the dark night
I have had a waking dream
A holy dream
A holy dream
A waking dream of life and light
That cheered me as a lovely beam
A lonely spirit guiding
With a ray turned back upon the past
While I aghast
Sit motionless through the misty night
Dimly peering at what once shone bright
Peeking wariy at what shone afar
What could there be more purely bright
In Truth's day-star?
In the consideration of the faculties
And impulses of the human soul
In consideration of our arrogance
Our radical, primitive, irreducible arrogance of reason
We have all overlooked the propensity
We saw no need for it
The paradoxical something which we may call perverseness
A mobile without motive
Through its promptings, we act without comprehensible object
Induction would have brought phrenology to admit this
We act for the reason we should not
For certain minds this is absolutely irresistible
The conviction of the wrong or impolicy of an action
Is often the unconquerable force
It is a primitive impulse
Elementary
The overwhelming tendency to do
Wrong for the wrong's sake
This impels us to its persecutions
Oh holy dream
We persist in acts
Because we feel that we should not persist in them
This is the combativeness of phrenology
We have a task before us which must be speedily performed
We know it will be ruinous to delay
Trumpet-tongued, the important crisis of our life calls
We glow
We are consumed with eagerness to commence work
Yet a shadow flits across the brain
The impulse increases to a wish
The wish to a desire
The desire to uncontrollable longing
And the longing in defiance of all consequences is indulged
We put off all until tomorrow
We tremble with the violence of the conflict within us
The definite with the indefinite
The substance with the shadow
There is no answer except that we feel perverse
The shadow prevails
Our energy returns
We will commit now
We will labor now
Oh holiest of dreams
But it is too late
We stand upon the brink of the precipice
We grow sick and dizzy
We go to shrink from danger but instead we approach it
We are intoxicated by the mere idea
Of a fall from such a great height
This fall, this rushing annihilation
For the very reason
It contains the most loathsome and ghastly images
Of death and suffering
For this reason do we now most impetuously desire it
There is no passion in nature
So demonic as the passion of him who
Shuddering upon the edge, meditates a plunge
We will these actions merely
Because we feel that we should not
Having realized this, I swoon
It is the spirit of the perverse
The idea of a poison candle struck my fancy
And I procured one for my victim
I will not vex you with impertinent details
But suffice it to say the verdict was
"Death by the visitation of God"
All went well for me
All went well for me
His estate inherited
I reveled in absolute security
I would never be found out
I was safe
I was safe
If I did not prove fool enough to make open confession
If I did not prove fool enough to make public confession
No sooner had I uttered those words
Than I felt an icy chill creep into my heart
I made a strong effort
To shake off this nightmare of the soul
I laughed
I whistled
I walked and then walked faster
I thought I saw a formless shape approaching me from behind
And then I ran
I pushed and shoved blindly
I thought I left a hand upon my throat
No mortal hand
I screamed
And then clearly, clearly
I enunciated pregnant sentences
That consigned me to the hangman and the hell
The fullest judicial conviction
Today I wear chains but tomorrow I shall be fetterless
But where?
Oh holy dream
Oh beam of light
I fall prostrate with excitement this holy night
Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes
I have felt the full knowledge
And force of their expression
And yet been unable to possess it
And have felt it leave me
As so many other things have left
The letter half-read
The bottle half-drunk
Finding
Finding in the commonest objects of the universe
A circle of analogies
Of metaphors
Ooohhh
For that expression
Which has been willfully
withheld from me
The access to the inner soul denied
I wanna know, ooohhh
I wanna know
I wanna know, oh
I wanna know
In consideration
In consideration of the faculties and impulses
Of the human soul
Of the human soul
In consideration
Of our arrogance
Of our arrogance
Our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason
We have all overlooked the propensity
We saw no need for it
The paradoxical something which we may call perverseness
Perverseness
Through its promptings we act without
Comprehensible object
We act for the reason we should not
We act for the reason we should not
For certain minds this is absolutely irre-, irre-
irresistible
irresistible
The conviction of the wrong
Or impolicy of an action
Is often the unconquerable force
The unconquerable force
It is a primitive impulse
It is a primitive impulse
Primitive impulse
The overwhelming tendency
The overwhelming tendency to do
Wrong for the wrong's sake
To do wrong for the wrong's sake
We persist in acts
Because we feel that we
should not persist in them
Because we feel we, feel we
should not persist, per-, persist in them, ah
Ooohhh
So I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna know
I wanna, I wanna know
I wanna, I
Ooohhh, we persist in action
We persist in action
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong
Ooohhh
Wrong, wrong
Oh we persist in action
Ah yeah yeah
When you know that it's wrong
In the science of the mind
there is no forgiving
Paralyzed I lay here sleeping
quiet as a little child
Heart starts beating, blood rushing pounding
moving quiet as a little lamb
In the science of the mind
limbs are bound devoid of movement
The injuries we do in kind
are visited upon us often
In the science of the mind
trying hard to move a shadow
Don't bury me I'm still alive
the science of the mind unyielding
The science of the mind unyielding
the science of the mind unyielding
It was many and many a year ago,
In a a kingdom by the sea,
That a maiden there lived whom you may know
By the name of annabel lee;
And this maiden she lived with no other thought
Than to love and be loved by me;
I was a child and she was a child,
In this kingdom by the sea:
But we loved with a love that was more than love
I and my annabel lee;
With a love that the winged seraphs of heaven
Coveted her and me;
And this was the reason that, long ago,
In this kingdom by the sea,
A wind blew out of a cloud, chilling
My beautiful annabel lee;
So that her high-born kinsman came
And bore her away from me,
To shut her up in a sepulchre
In this kingdom by the sea.
The angels, not half so happy in heaven,
Went envying her and me
Yes! that was the reason (as all men know,
In this kingdom by the sea)
That the wind came out of the cloud by night,
Chilling and killing my annabel lee;
But our love it was stronger by far than the love
Of those who were older than we
Of many far wiser than we
And neither the angels in heaven above,
Nor the demons down under the sea,
Can ever dissever my soul from the soul
Of the beautiful annabel lee,
For the moon never beams, without bringing me dreams
Of the beautiful annabel lee;
And the stars never rise, but I feel the bright eyes
Of the beautiful annabel lee;
And so, all the night-tide, I lie down by the side
Of my darling .. my darling .. my life and my bride,
In the sepulchre there by the sea,
In her tomb by the sounding sea
Well they call me a juicy hop-frog
you can see me in any wood bog
don't you know that they call me the hop-frog
hopping frog
I'm a hop-frog
a hop-frog
they call me the hop-frog
hop, hop-frog
They call me the hop-frog
see me in any wood bog
don't you know that call me a hop-frog
hop-frog
They call me the hop-frog
see me in a wood bog
they're calling me a hop-frog
hop-frog
You can see me in a ballroom
you can see me in a bedroom
you can see me in the woods
hop, hop-frog
They call me the hop-frog
they call you the hop-frog
well they call you the hop-frog
hop, hop-frog
Frog
Oh mellifluous dwarf
prince of all the jesters
Funny little thing you are
Make me laugh
As God's voluminous star
Gracious majesty
Today is not made for laughter day
This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets
Then comic ruin or suicidal jests
I'll be the judge of that thank you
Make me laugh le petite cur
Drink some wine
Lest you foul sweet time
Drink upsets me
please your liege
This would mark the death me
I said drink you scabrous whore
Are you deaf as well as short?
Kingdom's Sire
big as you are
Save such
bile for larger foes
Make me laugh
'Fore I stretch your neck like a giraffe
My love
The king by any other name a pissoir
You, my love tower over them all
They are but vermin beneath your heels
They are monkeys
Suit them, frame them to your own vision
But do not let one false word
Of mockery seep through to your vast heart
I have seen you from close and afar and your worth
Far exceeds your height, your width
The depth of your sorrow
Oh willful outcast doth thou not see the light of our love
Our linked fortunes
Our hearts melded together
Into one fine golden braided finery
They listen to the music of idiots and amuse themselves
With the sordid Miseries of their businesses
They are not the things of angels
Nor of any higher outpost that humanity might aspire to
Your loathsome vomitous
Businessman king is of the lowest order
His advisors
Crumbling mockeries of education driven by avarice
My love
Dress them in the suits of mockery
And in their advanced state of stupidity
And senility
Burn and destroy them so their ashes might join the compost
Which they so much deserve
If justice on this earth be fleeting
Let us for once hear the weeping
And the braying of the businessman king
Let them be the the orangutans they are
And set them blazing from the chandelier for all to see
Hanging from the ceiling by their ridiculous chains
And petticoats which you will have them wear
Under the guise of costumic buffoonery
He who underestimates
In time is bound to find the truth sublime
And hollow lie upon the grates of systemic disorder
Businessmen
You're not worth shitting on
Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I hold a mirror to my face
There are some lines that I could trace
To memories of loving you
A passion that breaks reason in two
I - I - I have to think and - I have to think and stop me now
If reminices make you frown
One thinks of what one hoped to be
And then faces reality
I wonder who started all this
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away?
Sometimes I wonder who am I
Who made the trees - who made the sky
Who made the storms - who made heartbreak?
I wonder how much life I can take
I see at last a future self
Were you alive I'd ask your help
But thinking puts me in a daze
And thinking never helped me anyway
You always were so negative
You never saw the positive
You always stand upon the edge
And dream of what it must be to be dead
I know I like to dream a lot
And think of other worlds that are not
I hate that I need air to breathe
I'd like to leave this body - and be free
You'd like to float like a mystic child
You'd like to kiss an angel on the brow
You'd love to solve the mistery of live
By cutting someone's throat or removing their heart
You'd like to see it beat
You'd like to hold your eyes
And though you know I'm dead
You'd like to hold my thighs
If it's wrong to think on this
To hold the dead past - to hold the dead past in your fist
Why were we - why were we given memories?
Let's lose our minds
Be set free!
Sometimes I wonder who am I
The world seeming to pass me by
A younger man now getting old
I have to wonder what the rest of life will hold
I wonder
I wonder who started all this - ooh
Was God in love and gave a kiss
To someone who later betrayed
And God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away
To someone who later betrayed
God less love sent us away...
Tomorrow is the seasonal ball
I propose costumes for you
and the honorable ministers to wear
Yes
All dress as orangutans
All your guests will run and scream
with their mouths agape
And try to hide
And you Sire will have last laugh
For such imperial cunning
I will reach, restore wrong
I will torture you
I will burn you
Dead
My prince
My prince
You light a fire .......
Burn, monkeys
Burn
I have a guardian angel
keep him in my head
When I'm afraid and alone
I call him to my bed
I have a guardian angel
who keeps bad things from me
The only way to ruin it would be for me
not to trust me
The only way to ruin it would be for me
not to trust me
I have a guardian angel
who's often saved my life
Through malevolent storms and crystal drums
the angel on my right
Has lifted me up and set me down
always showing me what's right
And if my instinct proved me wrong
the angel set it right
And if my instinct proved me wrong
the angel set it right
Have a guardian angel
I keep him in my head
And when I'm having nightmares
he shows me dreams instead
I have a ring, I have a dress
I have an empty shell
By the books below tea cups
I've kept a kind of hell
By the books below tea cups
I've kept a kind of hell
Panic and anxiety
so often in my head
But I had a guardian angel
who took care of me instead
The champagne cork the nightlight owl
a raven and a duck
The seed of pining parents
and your despairing love
The seed of pining parents
and your despairing love
Love and luck both have charmed lives
can change all things about
I had a guardian angel
that's what this is all about
I have a guardian angel
I keep him in my head
When I'm alone and become afraid
he saved my life instead
When I'm alone and become afraid
he saved my life instead
Guardian angel
guardian angel
Guardian angel
guardian angel
Guardian angel
I would cut my legs and tits off
When I think of Boris Karloff and Kinski
In the dark of the moon
It made me dream of Nosferatu
Trapped on the isle of Doctor Moreau
Oh wouldn't it be lovely
I was thinking Peter Lorre
When things got pretty gory as I
Crossed to the Brandenburg Gate
I was feeling snappy perhaps I'd been napping
And I'd just ate
A following heart can tear you apart
On a midnight to 8 shift
A graveyard romance can only give one chance
As the tombstones weave and breathe
Feeling happy when my heart got beating
On a Sunday afternoon
I dreamt of breezes going through the treeses
And stars were still illumed
I have three hearts that I keep apart
Trying to relate
To normal feelings and the nightime reelings
And some absynthe drunk so late
The cook got drunk and all the whores they shrunk
Onto the size of dessert plates
But me I'm happy cause I got my little nappy
And some opium to set me straight
I'm just a small town girl who wants to give it a whirl
While my looks still hold me straight
Straight up to illusion and fantasy's fusion
Of reality mixed with drink
I'm just a small town girl who's gonna give life a whirl
Looking at the Brandenburg Gate
I am a chorus of the voices
That gather up the magnets
Set before me
I attract you and repel you
A science of the heart
And blood and meaning
The coldness of most beauties
Is a challenge that our youth
Must quickly conquer
There is no time for guilt
Or second guessing, second guessing
Based on feeling
I am the truth, the beauty
That causes you to cross
Your sacred boundaries
I have no morals
Some think me cheap
And someone who despises
The normalcy of heartbreak
The purity of love
But I worship the young
And just formed angel
Who sits upon the pin of lust
Everything else
Bores me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up
Your life of reason
I want you on the floor
And in a coffin your soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune
Oh throw it away
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
For worship someone
Who actively despises you
I am the root
I am the progress
I am the aggressor
I am the tablet
These ten stories
Worship
Worship
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
I offer them to you as servants
Of the gold that you must give
Pain and evil have their place
Sitting here beside me
And I'll offer them, I offer them to you
As servants of the gold
That you must give to me
I want to see your suicide
I want to see you give it up, give it up
Your your life of reason
I want to see you on the floor
And in a coffin, soul shaking
Soul shaking
I want to have you doubting
Every meaning you've amassed
Like a fortune, like a fortune
Throw it away
For worship of someone who actively despises you
Who actively despises you
If I pump out blood in the sunshine
Oil on the wheel
That is blasted and busted away
A nail or a little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
A little piece of glass
Swarming like bees over the air
Off the pump off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Like bees over the air
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
Off the pump
Off the thing
The blood that I'm pumping away
If I pump blood in the sunshine
And you wear a leather box with azaleas
And I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
As I pump more blood
And it seeps through my skin
Will you adore the river
The stream, the trickle
The tributary of my heart
If I'm pumping blood
Like a common state worker
If I waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Would you think less of me
And my coagulating heart
Waggle my ass like a dark prostitute
Coagulating heart
Pumping blood
Would you top me off
Would you top me off as I deepen a curtsy
While you yell out, "mercy"
We grow apart
Would you rip and cut me
Use a knife on me
Be shocked at the boldness
The coldness of this little heart
Tied up in leather
Would you take the measure
Of the blood that I pump
In the manic confusion of love
Supreme violation
Supreme violation
"Oh, ah, ah, ah Jack I beseech you"
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation
Blood in the foyer
The bathroom
The tea room
The kitchen, with her knives splayed
I will swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack, Jack I beseech..."
"Jack, I beseech you, I beseech..."
In the end it was an ordinary heart
"Oh Jack I beseech you"
As I scream out my pain
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end, in the end, in the end
It was an ordinary heart
"Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
Supreme violation... Oh
"Jack, Jack, Jack I beseech you"
I call out your name
Blood in the foyer, the bathroom,
The tea room, the kitchen
And knives splayed
I swallow your sharpest cutter
Like a colored man's dick
Blood spurting from me
Blood spurting from me
"Oh Jack"
"Oh Jack, I beseech ya"
In the end it was an ordinary heart
In the end it was an ordinary heart
Pumping blood
I'm built like you are
I have a dress and a train
Your snake cold lips
Make a harsh straight line
That echoes through my brain
You're perfect
Let me lift a glass high
Let me follow in your footsteps
Let me follow in your sigh
Let me follow in your sigh
I'm a woman who likes men
But this is something else
I've never felt such stirrings
I feel like I
Was someone else
I wish you'd tie me up and beat me
Crush me like a kick
A bleeding strap across my back
Some blood that you could kiss
Oh kiss away, oh kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
I wish there was a strap of blood
That you could kiss away
Tie me with a scarf and jewels
Put a bloody gag to my teeth
I beg you to degrade me
Is there waste that I could eat
I am a secret lover
I am your little girl
Please spit into my mouth
I'm forever in your swirl
You're heartless and I love that
You have no use of me
But I open the sticks, sticky legs I bear
And then insert a fist, an arm
Some lost appendage
Please open me I beg
You are my goliath
You are my goliath
And I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Oh I am mistress dread
Open and release me
I love you in my head
Oh kiss away kiss away
Kiss away kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
All I ask my baby
Kiss away
You can't put a butterfly in a jar
If the effort's too high no matter who you are
You can't catch the moon, or the sun or the stars
It doesn't matter who you are
Iced honey
Now me I've tried a million tricks
To make life cold and make it stick
Not running heat that flames then out
But the proud piece of ice that always floats
Iced honey
If I can't trap a butterfly or a bee
If I can't keep my heart where I want it to be
If no matter how much soul and heart
I put to the wood
If a flaming heart is not that good
Iced honey
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
If violence mars your final hour
If you make others feel like jam
Poured on a piece of charbroiled lamb
If it's all mixed up and you cannot shout
And your oxygen starts to run out
If your final gasp has the recipe wrong
And instead of hello you say so long
If your energy starts to leak out
And people wonder what you're all about
A heartbreaker with an unattached heart
The story of love gives them all a start
And me, I've always been this way
Not by choice, just this way
I can't put my honey pot in a jar
Or a heart or a fist of some young boy
If you can't put a butterfly in a jar
No wonder no need to wonder where you are
It might seem like Hell, the river Styx
Your affection never sticks
No matter what you say, no matter what you do
A butterfly heart flies right past you
There's nothing to say, nothing to do
See if the ice will melt for you
Iced honey
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
I have a passionate heart
It can tear us apart
I have the loves of many men
But I don't love any of them
Why do I cheat on me
You have your feelings
I have mine
I spit upon you and change my mind
I have many hearts to break
And many, many, many more to take
Let the light of stars pour out
Like a candle in a spout
Let the wick recede and break
Let the starlight radiate
Why do you cheat on me
Why do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on thee
Why do I desecrate me
Why do I piss my dreams
That's because that's what it is
I have the drive
I got the scope
If I, if I, if I, could I give you a rope
Your love means zero to me
I'm a passionateless wave upon the sea
Passionateless wave upon the sea
Why, why, why
Do you cheat on me
Why, why, why
Do I cheat on thee
Oh why, do I cheat on me
Why do I cheat on myself
Well I got nobody else
I'm only young once
I want to taste it all and have fun
I have no real feelings in my soul
Where most have passion I got a hole
I really got nobody else
I want lovers like the rain
So many of them, so much the same
You say you love me, I know it's true
But I, I, I don't love you
Why do I cheat on me
Why do you cheat on me
Your love means zero to me
A passionateless wave
Your love means zero to me
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
I see you with your portraiture
Does he love you?
Does he love you too?
The brush strokes
Kiss your breasts and toes
I cry icicles in my stein
The heartbeats flutter
With an abnormal rhythm
The pain shoots through my body
A sword between my thighs
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
You're feeling less whore but you stimulate
The hatred smolders in your eyes
I'd drop to my knees in a second
To salivate in your thighs
But all I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
In you and your prickless lover
And his easel in his eyes
I feel the pain creep up my leg
Blood runs from my nose
I puke my guts out at your feet
You're more man than I
To be dead to have no feeling
To be dry and spermless like a girl
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
Marry me
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
More man than I
More man than I
Frustration
In my lexicon of hate
You're feeling less like a whore but you
Stimulate
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
All I do is fall over
I don't have the strength I once had
I want you so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want so much to hurt you
I want you as a wife
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Frustration is my lexicon of hate
Fru... fru... frustration, my lexicon of hate
I cry icicles
Heartbeats flutter
Abnormal rhythm
I wish that I could kill you
But I too love your eyes
I want you as my wife
I want you as my wife
Spermless like a girl
Lucky in feeling
More man than I
Marry me, marry me, marry me
I want you as a wife
Spermless like a girl
Puking my guts at your feet
More man than I
Fru... fru... fru... frustration
Frustration
Little dog who can't get in
Moaning at the bed side
Moaning from each limb
Little dog who can't get in
Can only cry but
Can not swim
Pony legs, little trot
Little dog has to wait a lot
The bigger dog has got his spot
And elbowed him away
Listen to him barking
Listen to him call
Little dog don't have much at all
A puny body and a tiny dick
A little dog can make you sick
If you got the money you can go to the top
The female dog don't care what you got
As long as you can raise that
Little doggie face to a cold hearted pussy
You could have a taste
A taste of what the big dog got
A taste of what the big dog got
The little dog with the one hundred dollar spot
Can run his tongue over the hot in trot
Hot in trot
Run his tongue over the hot in trot
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what you want
My small dog, he want what I got
Wants to run his tongue over my hot spot
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
The little man follows his nose
Counts his fingers and his toes
He still got those
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Following his nose
But it needs my money to buy
I'm an up while you're a down
I am an up while you're a down
The spring and the will follow me around
While you sniff your shit in the wind
Sniff your shit in the wind
Money can do anything
Money can do anything
Tell me what it is you want
Just tell me what it is you want
I'm an up while you're a down
The spring and the will follow me around
Tell me what it is you want
Tell me what it is you want
You sniff your shit in the wind
Follow me around
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
Pathetic little dog
You don't actually care
Love for you is no beginning
You're not really there
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I thought you were listening
Hallucination
I understand you think you're above it
The adolescent sense of the sky
The feeling of billowing heartbeats
The fingertips run through your hair
They run through your hair
Hallucination
Hallucination
Oh you think you're so special
That there's no law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
We're mere mortals below
Fingertips run through your hair
We are mere mortals below
Are meant to be peons
Are meant to be servants
Are meant to be dismissible objects
One fucks with
One fucks with
Poor pitiful creature
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My, my caring for you
Caring for you
Do you think we're a book
Some kind of a table
You can rest your feet on when you're able
Red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Poor pitiful creature
To notice the pining
The self deprivation
The self flagellation of you
Dear worshippers
We do like you regal
We do like you haughty
We do love to look upon your perfect body
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
The taste of your vulva and everything on it
We all really love you
And you have no meaning
You don't even see us
You were never caring
You go do what you do
You do it for you
No one exists with you
You're way above caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Thinking of you
Is another way of dying
Is another way of dying
I'm clawing your chest
'Til your collarbone bleeds
Piercing your nipples 'til I bite them off
I scratch your face and bite your shoulders
Way above caring
Way above caring
And your Kotex jukebox
Your Kotex jukebox
I'm doomed, I'm swearing
Waiting for you
In your high heels and nightie
Your leather dress squeaking
Latex now sweating, waiting for you
In your tincture
Your opium white bathrobe
Your white tiles run red now
Are we both dead now?
The liquid exchange of our heart
The liquid exchange of our heart
Are we both dead now?
You're way above caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring
My caring for you
My caring for you
You're way beyond caring
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Leave a trail upon the wake
That no one ever tries to take
Because waiting for you
Because thinking of you
Is another way of dying
You're way above caring
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
You poor pitiful creature
The mistake of feeling
The one who rejects you is the winner,
It's true
The winner in heartbreak
The winner in caring
The winner in every miniscule method of wearing
Your heart on your sleeve
A red star of idiocy
An idiot's idiocy
Your heart on your fuckin' sleeve
My caring for you
We were meant to be peons
We're meant to be peons
Mere mortals below
Meant to be servants
Meant to be dismissible objects one fucks with
Oh, oh, oh you're so special
No law meant for you
You come and go like the goddess you are
The fingertips run through your hair
A billowing heart beats
Feeling
Feeling
What a glorious feeling
To be so rejected
So rejected
An idiot's idiocy
My caring for you
You think I'm a book or a table
You can rest your fuckin' feet on
When you're able
The taste of your vulva, everything on it
The hair on your shoulders
The smell of your armpit
We do love you, to look upon your perfect body
We love you regal
We love you haughty
Oblivious to caring
Oblivious to caring
Caring
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oh my dear
Oblivious to caring
Are we really dead now?
Are we both dead now?
Would you come to me
If I was half drowning
An arm above the last wave
Would you come to me
Would you pull me up
Would the effort really hurt you
Is it unfair to ask you
To help pull me up
The window broke the silence of the matches
The smoke effortlessly floating
Pull me up
Would you be my lord and savior
Pull me up by my hair
Now would you kiss me, on my lips
Burning fever burning on my forehead
The brain that once was listening now
Shoots out its tiresome message
Won't you pull me up
Scalding, my dead father
Has the motor and he's driving towards
An island of lost souls
Sunny, a monkey then to monkey
I will teach you meanness, fear and blindness
No social redeeming kindness
Or - oh, state of grace
Would you pull me up
Would you drop the mental bullet
Would you pull me by the arm up
Would you still kiss my lips
Hiccup, the dream is over
Get the coffee, turn the lights on
Say hello to junior dad
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
Psychic savagery
The greatest disappointment
The greatest disappointment
Age withered him and changed him
Into junior dad
